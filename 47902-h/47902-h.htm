<h2>BOOK I<br />
<small>THE WHITE SHE-DEVIL&mdash;1494</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="bookblock">'At Siena was discovered another statue of Venus, to the huge joy of
the inhabitants. A great concourse, with much feasting and honour, set
it up over the fountain called "Il Fonte Gaja," as an adornment....</p>

<p class="bookblock">'But great tribulation having come upon the land by reason of the
Florentines, there arose one of the council, a citizen, and spake in this
wise: "Fellow-citizens, since the finding of this figure we have had much
evil hap, and if we consider how strictly idolatry is prohibited by our
faith, what shall we think but that God hath sent us this adversity by
reason of sin? I advise that we remove this image from the public square
of the city, deface it, break it in pieces, and send it to be buried in the
territory of the Florentines."</p>

<p class="bookblock">'All agreeing with this opinion, they confirmed it by a decree; and the
thing was put into execution, and the statue was buried within our confines.'
(<i>Notes of the Florentine sculptor, Lorenzo Ghiberti, XVth. century.</i>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="p2">I</h3>

<p>In Florence the guild of dyers had their shops hard by the
Canonica of Orsanmichele. The houses were disfigured by
every sort of shed, outhouse, and projection on crooked
wooden supports; tiled roofs leaned so close to each other
as almost to shut out the sky, and the street was dark
even in the glare of noon. In the doorways below, samples
of foreign woollen-stuffs were suspended, sent to Florence
to be dyed with litmus-lichen, with madder, or with woad
steeped in a corrosive of Tuscan alum. The street was
paved roughly, and in the kennel flowed many-coloured
streams, oozings from the dye vats. Shields over the portals
of the principal shops, or <i>Fondachi</i> were blazoned with the
arms of the Calimala (so the guild of dyers was named), 'on
a field gules, an eagle or, upon a ball of wool argent.'</p>

<p>Within one of these <i>Fondachi</i>, among huge account-books
and piles of commercial documents, sat Messer Cipriano
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Buonaccorsi, a worthy Florentine merchant, and Master of
the Noble Guild of the Calimala.</p>

<p>It was a cold March evening, and damp exhaled from the
choked and cumbered cellars; the old man was a-cold, and
he drew his worn squirrel-mantle tightly round him. A goose-quill
was stuck behind his ear, and with omniscient, though
weak and myopic eyes, that seemed at once careless and
attentive, he conned the parchment leaves of his ponderous
ledger; debit to the left, credit to the right; divided by
rectangular lines, and annotated in a round, even hand,
unadorned by stops, or capitals, or Arabic numerals, which
were considered frivolous innovations, impertinent in business-books.
On the first page was inscribed in imposing
characters: 'In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the
most blessed Virgin Mary, this book is begun in the year of
the Lord <span class="smcap lowercase">MCCCCLXXXXIV.</span>'</p>

<p>Having corrected an error in the number of bales received
in pledge, and satisfied himself as to the latest entries of
podded pepper, Mecca ginger, and bundles of cinnamon,
Messer Cipriano leaned wearily against the back of his chair,
closed his eyes, and meditated upon an epistle he must indite
for his emissary at the Wool Fair in Montpellier of France.
Just then some one entered, and the old man raising his
glance saw his <i>contadino</i>, Grillo, who rented from him certain
vineyards and fields belonging to his mountain-villa of San
Gervaso in the valley of the Mugnone. Grillo did obsequious
reverence, tendering a basket of brown eggs, carefully packed,
while at his belt clucked two fat chickens, their feet tied and
their heads hanging.</p>

<p>'Ah, Grillo!' exclaimed Buonaccorsi, with his customary
urbanity, 'has the Lord been gracious to you? Meseems,
we have the spring season at last.'</p>

<p>'Messer Cipriano, to us old men even the spring brings no
delight. Our old bones ache worse than before and cry
louder for the grave. I have brought your worship eggs and
young cockerels for Easter.' And he screwed up his greenish
eyes, revealing innumerable small creases all round them, the
effect of rude acquaintance with wind and sun. Buonaccorsi,
having thanked him for the gift, turned to business.</p>

<p>'Well, have you the men ready at the farm? Can we get
all done before day-break?'</p>

<p>Grillo sighed prodigiously, and meditated, leaning heavily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
on his staff. 'All is ready, and there are men enough. But
I ask you, Messer Cipriano, were it not better we waited a
little?'</p>

<p>'Nay, old man, you have said yourself that we must not
wait, lest the matter become known.'</p>

<p>'True. Yet the thing is terrible. It is sin. And the
days now are holy-days, days of fasting; and our work is of
another sort.'</p>

<p>'Well, I will take the sin on my own soul. Fear naught;
I will not betray you. Only tell me&mdash;shall we find what
we seek?'</p>

<p>'Why should we not? We have signs to guide us. Did
not our fathers know of the hill behind the mill at the Humid
Hollow? And at night there's the Jack o' Lantern over
San Giovanni. That means lots of this rubbish all round.
I have heard tell that not long ago, when they were digging
in the vineyard at Marignola, they drew a whole devil from
out the clay.'</p>

<p>'A devil? What manner of devil?'</p>

<p>'A bronze one with horns. He had hairy legs&mdash;goat's
legs&mdash;with hoofs. And a face which laughs. And he dances
on one leg and snaps his fingers. 'Twas very old; all green
and crumbled.'</p>

<p>'What did they do with it?'</p>

<p>'They made it into a bell for the new chapel of San
Michele.'</p>

<p>Messer Cipriano was beside himself. 'Grillo, you should
have told me of this before!'</p>

<p>'Your worship had gone to Siena.'</p>

<p>'You should have sent after me. I would have despatched
some one&mdash;I would have come myself&mdash;I would have grudged
no expense&mdash;I would have cast ten bells for them in its
place. The idiots! To make a Dancing Faun&mdash;perhaps a
real Scopas&mdash;into a bell!'</p>

<p>'Ay, they showed their folly. But, Messer Cipriano, be
not wroth. They are punished: for since they hung that new
bell the worms have eaten the apples, and the olives have
failed. And the tone of the bell is bad.'</p>

<p>'How so?'</p>

<p>'That's not for me to say. It hasn't the proper note.
It brings no joy to the Christian heart. Somehow it sounds
unmeaning. 'Tis what one might expect: one can't get a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Christian bell out of a dumb devil. Be it not spoke to anger
your worship, but, Messer Cipriano, the good Father is right;
of all this filth they dig up, no good is going to come. We
must go to work with prudence and defend ourselves with
the cross and with prayers; for the Devil is subtle and
powerful and the son of a dog, and he creeps in at one ear
and out at the other. We were led into temptation even by
that stone arm which Zaccheo found at the Hill of the Mill.
'Twas the Evil One tempted us, and we came to harm by it.
Lord defend us! 'Tis dreadful even to remember!'</p>

<p>'How got you it, Grillo?'</p>

<p>'The thing happened last autumn on the Eve of Martinmas.
We were sitting us down to sup, and the good woman
had put the porridge on the table, when my nephew Zaccheo
came bursting in from his digging in the field on the Hill
of the Mill. "Master! O master!" he cried, and his face
was all drawn and changed, and his teeth chattered. "The
Lord be with you, my son!" says I, and he went on: "O
Lord, master! there's a corpse creeping out from under the
pots! Go yourself, master, and see." So we crossed ourselves
and we went. By this time 'twas dark, and the moon
was getting up behind the trees. There was the old olive-stump,
and beside it where the earth was dug was some
shining thing. I stooped, and saw 'twas an arm, very white,
and with round dainty fingers, like those of the city ladies.
"Good Lord," thinks I, "what sort of devilment is this?"
I let down the lantern into the hole, and that arm moved
and signalled to me with its finger! That was more than I
could bear, and I cried out, and my knees bent under me.
But Monna Bonda, my grandame, whom they call a wise
woman, and who has all her life in her though she be so old,
chided me, saying, "Fool, what is it you fear? Do not your
eyes tell you yon thing is neither of the living nor of the
dead, but is a stone?" And she snatched at it and pulled
it forth out of the earth. "Nay, grandame," I bade her,
"let it be; touch it not; rather let me bury it lest mischief
befall us." "Not so," quoth she; "but take we it to the
church, and let the Father exorcise it." But she deceived me,
for she brought it not to the priest, but hid it in the chimney-corner,
where in her cot she keeps gear of all sorts&mdash;rags,
unguents, and herbals, and spells. And when I made
insistence, she insisted too and kept it. And from that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
day 'tis very certain the old beldame hath done cures of
great marvel. Is it a toothache? she doth but touch the
cheek with the idol and the swelling is gone. She salves
fevers, colics, falling sickness. If a cow is in labour and
cannot bring forth, Monna Bonda touches her with that same
stone hand, and the cow lows, and there's the calf, kicking
in the straw. The noise of these wonders has gone abroad,
and the old woman has swelled her money-chest. But no
good has come of it, for Don Faustino has not allowed me
one day's peace. He speaks against me in his preaching,
in church before them all. He calls me the son of perdition
and the child of the Devil, and he declares he will tell of it to
the bishop, and will deny me the Communion. The boys run
after me in the street, and point and say, "There goes Grillo,
the sorcerer, and his grandame is a witch, and they have
sold themselves to the Evil One." Even in the night I get
no rest. Meseems that stone hand rises up and lies softly
on my neck, and then of a sudden takes me by the throat
and would strangle me, till I essay to cry out, and cannot.
"Bad jesting, this," I think to myself. So at last one morning,
ere it was light, the old woman having gone forth to
pick her herbs, I got up and broke open her cot, and found
the thing, and brought it to you. Lotto, the rag-picker,
would have given me ten <i>soldi</i> for it, and of you I only had
eight; but I am ready to sacrifice not only two <i>soldi</i>, but even
my life for your worship. May the Lord give you His holy
benediction, and to Madonna Angelica, and to your sons
and your grandsons!'</p>

<p>'It seems, then, by what you tell me, Grillo,' said Messer
Cipriano thoughtfully, 'that we shall have findings on that
Hill of the Mill?'</p>

<p>'We are like enough to find,' said the old man with a profound
sigh; 'only we may not tell Don Faustino. If he hear
of it he will dress my head without a comb; and he can do
your worship a mischief, too, for he can raise the people and
not let you finish your work. Well, well&mdash;we must pray the
Lord to show us mercy! But in the meanwhile, my honoured
benefactor, do not abandon me, but say a word for me to the
judge.'</p>

<p>'What? anent the strip of land the miller would take
from you?'</p>

<p>'That is it, master. The miller is a cunning rascal, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
knows how to catch the devil by the tail. I, you see, gave a
heifer to the judge; but the miller gave him a lined cow. I
fear me the judge will decide for the miller, because the suit
is not yet concluded, and already the cow has a fine bull-calf.
I pr'ythee, speak for me&mdash;father that you are to me. This
which we do on the Hill of the Mill, I do only for your
kindness. There is no other I would have let bring such a
sin upon my conscience.'</p>

<p>'Be at ease, Grillo. I will speak for you; the judge is my
friend. Now take your steps to the kitchen, and eat and
drink. To-night we will go together to San Gervaso.'</p>

<p>The old man, with many reverences, went out, and Messer
Cipriano betook himself to his little chamber near the storehouse.
It was a museum of marbles and bronzes, hung on
walls, arranged on benches. Medals and old coins were
assorted on cloth-covered benches; and fragments of statues,
not yet pieced together, were waiting in huge cases. Through
his trade-agents in many countries he procured antiquities
from all classic grounds; from Athens, Smyrna, Halicarnassus,
Cyprus, Leucosia, Rhodes, from the remoter Egypt, from the
heart of the Levant. The Master of the Guild of the Calimala
glanced over his treasures, and then sank into profound consideration
of customs-dues on the import of fleeces; and
finally composed the letter to his factor at the Wool Fair in
Montpellier.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Meantime, in the hinder-part of the warehouse, heaped
with bales, and lighted only by the glimmer of a lamp before
the image of the Madonna, three lads, Dolfo, Antonio, and
Giovanni were gossiping together. Dolfo, Messer Buonaccorsi's
clerk, a red-haired, snub-nosed, good-natured youth,
was entering the number of ells of cloth which Antonio da
Vinci, old for his years, with glassy eyes and thin, rough,
black locks, was rapidly measuring with the Florentine
measure, called a <i>canna</i>: Giovanni Boltraffio, a student of
painting from Milan, a big boy of nineteen, but shy and
awkward, with innocent, sad, grey eyes, and an irresolute
expression, was sitting cross-legged on a made-up bale, and
listening with all his ears.</p>

<p>'This is what we have come to,' cried Antonio excitedly;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
'digging heathen gods out of the ground!' Then he added,
dictating to Dolfo, 'of brown Scotch faced-cloth, 32 <i>braccia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
6 fingers, 8 nails.' Then, having folded the measured piece,
he threw it into its place, and raising his finger with the
gesture of a menacing prophet, in imitation of Fra Girolamo
Savonarola, he cried, '<i>Gladius Dei super terram cito
et velociter!</i> In the island of Patmos San Giovanni had
a vision: he saw the angel lay hold on the dragon, that old
serpent, which is the Devil, and bind him a thousand years,
and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and
set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no
more till the thousand years should be fulfilled. To-day
Satan has been released from his prison; to-day the thousand
years are at an end; the false gods, forerunners and followers
of Antichrist, are creeping forth from under the seal of the
angel back into the world for the temptation of men! Woe
to those who live on the earth or on the sea!&mdash;Of thin, yellow,
Brabant cloth, 17 <i>braccia</i>, 4 fingers, 9 nails!'</p>

<p>'How think you, then, Antonio?' asked Giovanni, with
alarmed and eager interest; 'all these signs bear witness&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay! You see, the hour has come. Not alone are
they digging up the old gods, but they are creating new ones
in their likeness. Painters and sculptors alike weary themselves
in the service of Moloch&mdash;that is, the Devil. They
turn the House of God into the temple of Satan; in the
sacred pictures, under the guise of martyrs and saints, they
paint the gods of uncleanness, and to these the people pray;
in place of John the Baptist they give us Bacchus; for the
holy Mother of God we get the shameless Venus. The
pictures should be burned with fire, and their ashes strewn
upon the wind!'</p>

<p>Suppressed fire flashed from the dull, dark eyes of the
zealous clerk; and Giovanni, not daring a retort, held his
peace. His delicate, childlike eyebrows contracted under
the stress of thought. At last, however, he said: 'Antonio,
they tell me Messer Leonardo, your kinsman, takes scholars
into his painting-room. I have long wished&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Antonio frowned and interrupted him. 'If you would lose
your soul, Giovanni, then go to Messer Leonardo!'</p>

<p>'What? Why?'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>'Though he be my near kinsman, and though he have
lived twenty years longer than I, nevertheless in the Scripture
it is written: "From an heretic, after the first and second
admonition, turn thou away." Leonardo is a heretic and an
infidel. His mind is darkened by Satanic pride; he seeks
to penetrate into the mysteries of nature by steeping himself
in mathematics and black magic.' Then, raising his eyes
to heaven, he repeated from Savonarola's latest discourse:
'"The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. We
know them, these learned men; they all go to the house of
the devil."'</p>

<p>'And have you heard, Antonio,' persisted Giovanni, still
shyly, 'that Messer Leonardo is here in Florence? He has
even now arrived from Milan.'</p>

<p>'For what purpose?'</p>

<p>'The duke has sent him to buy, if possible, pictures from
the galleries of the late Lorenzo the Magnificent.'</p>

<p>'Well, if he be here, then here he is. 'Tis of no moment
to me,' said Antonio, turning away; and he proceeded to
measure a length of green cloth with his <i>canna</i>.</p>

<p>From the church, bells rang out the call to vespers, and
Dolfo stretched himself and clapped-to the ledger with an
air of relief; for this day work was over, and the shops and
the warehouses were shutting.</p>

<p>Giovanni stepped into the street. A narrow strip of grey
sky, faintly tinged with the roseate of evening, showed
between the humid roofs: a fine rain fell through the
windless air. Suddenly from a window in a neighbouring
alley was wafted a song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'O vaghe montanine pastorelle</p>
<p>Donde venite si leggiadre e belle?'</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>(O shepherd-girls so fair,</p>
<p>Say from what mountain air</p>
<p class="i2">Light-footed have ye strayed?)</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The voice was resonant and young: from the measured beat
of the treadle Giovanni guessed at a loom, and at a girl
singing as she threw the shuttle. He listened with vague
enjoyment, and remembered that the spring had come, and
felt his heart swelling with strange emotions of tenderness
and melancholy.</p>

<p>'Nanna! Nanna! Where hast thou got to, thou little
devil? What hath happened to thine ears? Haste thee!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
The vermicelli grows cold.' After which there was a swift
clapping of wooden pattens across the floor, and then silence.</p>

<p>Giovanni stood long, his eyes on the window, the gay
song echoing in his ears like the far-off beatings of some
shepherd's pipe&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'O vaghe montanine pastorelle&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then sighing softly to himself he entered the house of the
Master of the Calimala, and mounting the winding stair, with
its worm-eaten banisters, he presented himself in the great
room, which served as a library, and in which, bending over
a desk, was Giorgio Merula, the historiographer of the Court
of the Duke of Milan.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Merula had come to Florence on a mission from his lord,
to purchase rare books from the library of the great Lorenzo.
He was lodged in the house of Buonaccorsi, as great an
enthusiast as himself for the learning and the arts of the
ancients. Journeying to Florence he had fallen into an
acquaintance with Giovanni Boltraffio at a road-side inn, and
under the pretext that he required an amanuensis, he had
brought him in his company to Messer Cipriano's house.</p>

<p>When Boltraffio entered, Merula was in the act of examining
with reverent attention a much-worn volume, which had the
appearance of a Missal or a Psaltery. He gingerly passed a
damp sponge over the parchment&mdash;parchment of the most
delicate kind, made from the skin of a still-born lamb; here
and there he rubbed it with pumice-stone, smoothed it with
the blade of a knife and with a polisher; then holding it up
to the light, studied it afresh.</p>

<p>'Dainty darlings!' he murmured, sucking in his lips with
delight; 'come forth to the light of heaven! Ah, how many
and how beautiful ye are!'</p>

<p>He raised his bald head from his work and showed a
bloated, red-nosed countenance, mobile brows, and eyes
small and colourless, but brimming with vivacity; poured
wine into a cup beside him on the window-sill, drank it,
coughed, and was returning to his work when he caught sight
of Giovanni.</p>

<p>'Ha, little monk!' he called out merrily. 'You have been
lacking to me: "Where can my little monk be gone?" quoth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
I. "Fallen in love, of a surety, with one of the fair maids of
Florence." Fair enough, I warrant you, and falling in love
is no sin. Nor have I been wasting my time neither. You
never have seen such a pretty piece in your life. Will you
have me show her to you? Not I; for you'll be whispering
the thing to the four winds! And to think I bought her for
a song from a Hebrew rag-vendor! Well, well, I suppose I
must show you; you only!' And beckoning mysteriously
he whispered, 'Come here with you&mdash;closer&mdash;here!'</p>

<p>And he pointed to a page closely covered with the angular
characters of ecclesiastical writing: praises of the Virgin,
psalms, prayers, interspersed with huge musical notation.
Then he opened the book at another page, and raised it to
the light on a level with Giovanni's eyes; the boy noticed
that where Merula had scraped away the ecclesiastical
writing there emerged other characters&mdash;barely distinguishable&mdash;not
letters, but the ghosts of letters, pallid, attenuated,
faint, still lingering impressed upon the parchment.</p>

<p>'See you? See you?' cried Merula, triumphantly; 'is it
not a darling? Did I not tell you, little brother, 'twas a
pretty piece!'</p>

<p>'But what is it?' asked Giovanni, astounded.</p>

<p>'That's what I can't yet tell you. Fragments of an antique
anthology; new riches it may be of the Hellenic muse. And,
perchance, but for me they would never have come out into
God's light&mdash;would have been entombed to the end of time
under antiphons and psalms of penitence!' And Merula
explained to his pupil how some Middle Age, monkish copyist,
wishing to use the precious parchment, had expunged, as he
thought, the old Pagan writing, and scrawled his pieties over
it. As the old man spoke, the sun filled the room with its
slowly dying, evening red; in this last radiance the shade of
the antique letters, the ghost of the ancient writing, showed
itself with redoubled clearness.</p>

<p>'You see! you see!' cried Merula in an ecstasy, 'The
dead are rising from their age-long sepulchres! It is a hymn
to the Olympian gods! Already you can decipher the first
lines!'</p>

<p>And translating from the Greek, he read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Glory to the gentle, the richly-crowned Dionysus,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Glory to thee, far-darting Ph&oelig;bus, silver-bowed, terrible,</p>
<p>&nbsp;God of the flowing curls, slayer of the sons of Niobe&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
And here is a hymn to that Venus, of whom you, little monk,
have such a mighty dread:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Glory to thee, golden-limbed mother, Aphrodite,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Delight of the gods and of mortals.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>But here the verses broke off, hidden under the pious over-writing.
Giovanni lowered the book, and at once the traces
of the old Greek letters grew faint and confused, sinking into
the yellow smoothness of the parchment. Nothing was visible
but the clear, black, greasy characters of the monkish scribe,
the penitential psalm, and the huge square notes for the
chant:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
'Give ear to my prayer, O God, and hide not thyself from my supplication.
My heart is sore pained within me, and the terrors of death are
fallen upon me.'
</p></blockquote>

<p>The roseate reflection faded away, and darkness filled the
room. Merula poured wine from the earthen pitcher, drank,
and offered it to his companion.</p>

<p>'To my health, boy. <i>Vinum super omnia bonum diligamus!</i>
You refuse? Well, well! as you will. I will drink
for you. But what is ill with you, little monk? You are as
green as if you were drowning. Has that bigot of an Antonio
been scaring you with his prophesyings? Spit on them,
Giovanni, spit on them! A pox upon all these croakings
of ill-voiced ravens! Confess now, you have been with
Antonio?'</p>

<p>'Ay.'</p>

<p>'And of what did he speak?'</p>

<p>'Of Antichrist, and of Messer Leonardo da Vinci.'</p>

<p>'So I thought! You have no speech but of Leonardo!
Has he bewitched you, simpleton? Hear me now, lad;
remove that folly out of your head, and content you as my
secretary. I will show you the world; teach you grammar,
law; make you an orator and a court poet. There's the
road to riches and fame. Painting! what rubbish is that?
Seneca called it a trade&mdash;no business for a free man. Turn
your eyes upon the artists; are they not all ignorant, rude
persons&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Nay, I have been told Messer Leonardo is a great scholar.'</p>

<p>'You tell me news. Where is his Latin, pr'ythee? He
confounds Cicero and Quintilian, and has not even a smack
of Greek about him. A scholar you call him, do you?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
'But,' urged Boltraffio, 'he has made wondrous machines;
and his studies of the phenomena of nature&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Machines! pf&mdash;f! Studies of nature! How far is that
going to take you? In my <i>Elegantiæ Linguæ Latinæ</i> I have
culled more than two thousand turns of speech; on my soul,
new, and elegance itself. Would you know how much it cost
me? But to apply wheels to machinery, and to watch the
manner of the flying of birds and the sprouting of the grass
in the fields&mdash;call you that learning? 'Tis the idleness, the
vain toying of babes.'</p>

<p>The old man paused: his face had grown stern. Then
taking his young friend by the arm, he continued with
gravity:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Hearken, Giovanni; and what I say to you burn it deep
into your mind. Our teachers are the Greeks and the
Romans; they have done all that the mind of man can do
upon this earth. For us there is nothing left but to follow in
their footsteps: is it not written, "The disciple is not greater
than his lord?"' He lifted his wine, and looking straight into
Giovanni's eyes with malicious mirth, all his lines and wrinkles
dissolving in one broad smile, he added:&mdash;</p>

<p>'O youth! youth! I look upon you, little monk, and I
envy you. You are a bud blowing in the spring, that is what
you are. And you, simpleton, contemn women, and scorn
wine, and would make of yourself a hermit and a recluse.
For all that, you have a little devil there in your heart; oh,
I read you well enough, my friend, through and through to
your very soul! Some day that little devil will peep out; it
is vain for you to deny it. However glum you may be, there
are those who will be merry in your company. See, Giovanni,
<i>carino</i> you're this parchment&mdash;penitential psalms outside,
and under them a hymn to Aphrodite!'</p>

<p>'Messer Giorgio,' said Giovanni, 'it grows dark; were it
not well I brought the lights?'</p>

<p>'Why this haste, lad? It pleases me to converse in the
twilight, and to recall my lost youth.' His tongue had grown
stammering and his phrases less perspicuous. 'I know,' he
muttered, 'that you are gazing at me, and thinking, "He is
drunk, the old rascal, and talking his folly." Yet I have that
here within me,' and he tapped his bald forehead complacently
and nodded. 'I speak not for boasting,' he went
on, 'but inquire of the scholars whether any have ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
surpassed Merula in the elegance of his Latin. Who was it who
discovered Martial? Who read the famed inscription on the
gate of Tibur? That meant climbing till your head reeled,
stones breaking from under your feet, as you clung to a bunch
of twigs and thought to fall headlong. Whole days under
the blazing sun, just to read and to copy those few ancient
letters! And the peasant maids as they passed would cry to
each other, "See yon fat quail up there seeking a nesting
place!" And I would answer them with some gallantry,
and when they had passed by would set me to my work
again. Once, concealed under the ivy and the thorns, where
the stones had fallen in ruin, I found these two sole words,
"<i>Gloria Romanorum!</i>"' And as if listening to the echo
of majestic utterance too long silenced, Merula repeated in
low, awestruck tones, '"<i>Gloria Romanorum!</i>"'&mdash;Glory of the
Romans!'</p>

<p>But then, with an uncertain wave of the hand, he added,
'By my troth! 'tis something to remember, even though the
past returns no more.' And raising his glass, he sang hoarsely
the students' drinking-song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Not a single jot miss I,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Not a single drop, Sir!</p>
<p>&nbsp;All my life to the cask I go,</p>
<p>&nbsp;And by the cask I'll stop, Sir.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Wine I love and singing to 't,</p>
<p>&nbsp;And the Latin Graces;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If I drink my throat'll do 't</p>
<p>&nbsp;Better than Horatius.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Vintage spins our brains about</p>
<p>&nbsp;<i>Dum vinum potamus</i>;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Lads, to Bacchus let us shout,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<i>Te Deum laudamus!</i>'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>He fell a-coughing and was unable to finish. By this time
it was dark, and Giovanni could barely see his master's face.
Outside it was still raining, and the swollen and frequent drops
plashed noisily in the streaming courtyard below.</p>

<p>'Hear me, little monk,' stuttered Merula; 'what was it I
was saying? My wife is a handsome woman&mdash;no&mdash;that
wasn't it. Have patience. Yes, I have it now. You know
the line: "<i>Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento</i>."
Ah! they were the giants, the lords of the universe!'
Here his voice shook, and Giovanni saw tears in his eyes.
'I repeat, giants. While to-day&mdash;it is a scandal to speak it!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
but let us take this duke of ours, Ludovico Il Moro, Duke of
Milan. True it is I am paid by him, am writing his history,
am a sort of Titus Livius, and am comparing the cowardly
hare, the man of straw, to Pompey and to Cæsar; but in my
soul, Giovanni, in my soul'&mdash;He stopped, and glanced at
the door with the suspiciousness of a practised courtier;
then bending closer to his companion, he whispered, 'In the
soul of old Merula the love of liberty is not dead, and will
never die. Repeat it not, but I tell you our times are evil,
evil as never before. And the men! it sickens me to see
them; rotten! mere clods of earth! And they curl up
their noses, and think themselves as the ancients. I would
fain know what they are so proud of. Hearken; an
acquaintance of mine writes to me from Greece, that not
many weeks ago in the island of Chios, the convent washer-women
as they were beating the linen at dawn, found on the
seashore&mdash;a god! a real ancient god; a Triton with his fishy-tail,
and fins, and scales. The silly fools were affrighted and
fled, thinking it the Devil. But when they saw him weak
and old, and it would seem sick, lying on his belly on the
sand, and warming his green scales in the sun, his hair grey,
and his eyes dim as those of a sucking babe, then they took
courage, the cowardly wretches! and came around him
showering him with Christian prayers, and beat him to death
like a dog; he, the ancient deity, last of the mighty gods of
the ocean; it might be a scion of Poseidon himself!'</p>

<p>And the old man shook his head sorrowfully, and maudlin
tears rolled down his cheeks as he thought of the sea-monster
done to death by Christian laundresses. A servant
entered bearing a candle, and closed the shutters; with the
darkness the pagan phantoms shrank away and vanished.
The pair were called to supper, but Merula was so heavy
with wine that they had to carry him to bed.</p>

<p>It was long before Boltraffio slept, and as he listened to
the peaceful snores of Messer Giorgio, he thought, as usual,
of Leonardo da Vinci.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Giovanni had been sent to Florence by his uncle, Oswald
Ingrim, the painter on glass (<i>magister a vitreis</i>), a German
from Grätz, and pupil of Johann Kirchheim, the famous Strasburg
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
master. He was to buy certain transparent and brilliant
pigments which could be obtained only in the Tuscan city,
and were required by Ingrim for his work in Milan Cathedral.
The boy was the natural son of Reinold the lapidary,
Oswald's brother, and had got the name of Boltraffio from
his Lombard mother, whom Oswald asserted to be a shameless
woman and the cause of his brother's ruin. Brought up
by his crabbed uncle, Giovanni was a lonely and frightened
child, reared on tales of unclean powers, demons, hags, sorcerers,
and were-wolves. His special horror was a certain
demon which, according to the North Italian tradition,
appeared under the form of a woman, and was called the
'White She-devil,' or the 'Mother of the Snowy Eyebrow.'
Yet even in his earliest infancy, when his uncle would silence
his sobs with threats of the <i>Diavolessa bianca</i>, the child felt a
curiosity mingling with his terror, a shrinking wish that some
day he might meet the white one face to face, and behold her
countenance with his own eyes.</p>

<p>When the boy was grown, Ingrim handed him over as
pupil to Fra Benedetto the sacred painter. This was a
kind and simple-minded old man, who taught that the first
step in beginning a picture was to invoke God Omnipotent
and the beloved Virgin, St. Luke the first Christian painter,
and all the saints in Paradise; the second to put on the
cloak of charity, fear, patience, and obedience; the last, to
temper his colours with yelk of egg, and the juice from
young fig-branches mixed with wine, and to prepare his
panels of old beechwood by rubbing them with the ashes
of bones&mdash;if possible the wing bones of capons. His precepts
were endless and minute: Giovanni soon learned the
contemptuous phrase with which he dismissed the colour
known as Dragon's Blood. 'Let it lie; 'twill bring you no
credit,' and Giovanni surmised that the same words had
been said by Fra Benedetto's teacher, and by the teacher of
his teacher before him. Constant was the smile of quiet
pride with which Benedetto initiated his pupil into the
secrets of his art. For instance, in the painting of youthful
faces the eggs of urban hens were essential: the rural hen
laying an egg with a ruddy yelk only suited for the delineation
of countenances wrinkled and swarthy. Notwithstanding
these subtleties, Fra Benedetto was a painter simple and
innocent as a child: he prepared himself for work by fast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
and vigil; each time he depicted the Crucifixion his face was
bathed in tears.</p>

<p>Giovanni loved his master, and had considered him the
first of painters; this opinion had however been shaken of
late. Fra Benedetto, expounding his one anatomical rule,
viz., that the length of a man's body must be reckoned at
eight faces and two-thirds, was used to add in the same perfunctory
tone in which he spoke of Dragon's Blood: 'As for
the bodies of women, we will not allude to them, for they
have no proportions.' This dogma was as much an article
of faith with him as these others: that all fish are dark-coloured
above and bright below; or that men's ribs are
fewer than women's by reason of God's method in the
creation of Eve. For an allegorical representation of the
elements, he drew a mole to signify earth; a fish, water; a
salamander, fire; a chameleon, air; but, supposing the word
'chameleon' an augmentative of 'camel,' the simple monk
showed the fluid element as a colossal camel, its jaws gaping
alarmingly in its efforts to breathe. Nor were his remaining
notions more accurate. Doubts therefore crept into
Giovanni's mind, and a mutinous spirit, which Fra Benedetto
called 'the devil of worldly knowledge.' When,
shortly before his journey to Florence, the lad chanced to
see certain drawings of Leonardo da Vinci's, his doubts grew
with such rapidity that he was no longer able to stifle them.</p>

<p>To-night, here in the Tuscan city, as he lay beside the
peacefully-snoring Messer Giorgio, he turned all this over in
his mind for the thousandth time; but the more he thought
the more puzzled he became. Then he resolved to invoke
celestial aid, and full of hope, raising his eyes to the impenetrable
darkness of night, he prayed thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Lord, help me and forsake me not. If Messer Leonardo
be truly a godless man, in whose skill lieth temptation and
sin, rid me of the thought of him; purge my mind of the
memory of his drawings, and deliver me from evil. But if,
while pleasing Thee and glorifying Thy name in the noble
art of painting, it be yet possible to know all which is
hidden from Fra Benedetto, and which I am so fain to
learn (such as anatomy, perspective, and the laws of light
and shade), then, O God, make strong my will, and lighten
my eyes, that I may doubt no more; and permit that Messer
Leonardo may receive me into his studio, and that Fra
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Benedetto may grant me his pardon, and may know that I
am in nowise guilty in Thy sight.'</p>

<p>After this fervent prayer, Giovanni felt a balsam descend
upon his heart: little by little confusion came upon his
thoughts; he fancied himself back with his uncle, the glass-worker,
and listening to the hissing of the glass as the white-hot
steel was plunged into it. He saw the twisting of the
leaden ribbons, which form the frames for the several pieces
of coloured glass: he heard the voice of Oswald commanding
more notches at the edge of the lead for the fixing of the
glass; then all vanished: he rolled to his other side and
slept.</p>

<p>And a vision came to him, which in after years he often
recalled to mind. For he saw himself standing in the gloom
of a vast cathedral, and before a many-coloured, Gothic window.
On it was depicted the vintage of that mystic vine
whereof the Saviour had said, 'My Father is the husbandman.'
The naked body of the Crucified lay in the winepress, blood
flowing from His wounds. Popes, cardinals, emperors were
receiving it into vats and casks. The Apostles were throwing
in grapes; St. Peter was treading them. In the background,
prophets and patriarchs were trenching the vineyard and
pruning the vines. A waggon was passing, drawn by the
lion, the bull, and the eagle, driven by St. Matthew.</p>

<p>Such painted allegories Giovanni had seen in his uncle's
workshop; nowhere such colours, dark, yet with the gleam of
jewels. Chiefly he marvelled at the crimson of the Saviour's
blood. From the depths of the cathedral came the faint
echoing of his favourite chant:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'O fior di castitate,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Odorifero giglio</p>
<p>&nbsp;Con gran suavitate</p>
<p>&nbsp;Sei di color vermiglio.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the song died away, the window glowed no longer, and
the harsh voice of Antonio da Vinci shouted in his ear:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Flee! Flee for your life! <i>She</i> cometh!'</p>

<p>Nor did he need to inquire who, for he knew the <i>Diavolessa
bianca</i> was behind him. A waft of icy air; and then
a heavy hand, not human, had taken hold at his throat,
and was choking him. He seemed to be dying, cried out,
and awoke&mdash;to see Messer Giorgio standing by his side and
dragging away the coverlet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
'Eh! pull yourself from your bed or they will depart
without us. Arise! the hour is already past,' cried the
antiquarian.</p>

<p>'What! Whither?' stammered Giovanni, half-asleep.</p>

<p>'Whither? Can you forget? To the villa of San
Gervaso, to dig at the Hill of the Mill.'</p>

<p>'I go not thither.'</p>

<p>'You go not? What have I waked you for? Why have I
bidden them saddle the black mule that the two of us may
travel at ease? A truce to this stubbornness. Get up!
Get up! Nay, then, a word in your ear, Giovannino: Messer
Leonardo will be there.'</p>

<p>Giovanni leaped to his feet, and without another word
threw on his clothes.</p>

<p>Presently they were in the courtyard, where all was ready
for the start. Grillo was running hither and thither advising
and directing. At last they set out. Other friends of
Cipriano's, and among them Leonardo da Vinci, were to
meet them later, by another path to San Gervaso.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>V</h3>

<p>The rain was over, and the north wind had banished the
clouds. Stars scintillated in the moonless heaven, like
little wind-blown lamps. Resin-torches flared and fluttered,
scattering sparks. The horsemen took their way by the Via
Ricasoli, past San Marco and the serrated gate of San Gallo.
Here the sentinels argued and swore, but were too sleepy to
perceive what was on foot; and presently egress was secured
by a good bribe. Outside the gate, the road followed the
deep and narrow valley of the Mugnone. After passing
several meagre villages, where the streets were even narrower
than those in Florence, and the rough stone houses were as
tall as fortresses, the party emerged into an olive-grove
owned by the <i>contadini</i> of San Gervaso. Dismounting at the
junction of two roads, they walked to the Hill of the Mill,
hard by Messer Cipriano's vineyard. Here men awaited them
with spades and mattocks; and here, behind the hill, beyond
the marsh known as the Humid Hollow, the villa walls
showed shadowy white through the darkness of the trees.
Tall cypresses stood up black from the summit of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
hill, and down below on the Mugnone was the name-giving
watermill.</p>

<p>Grillo signified where, to his thinking, they ought to dig;
Merula suggested another place; and Strocco, the gardener,
swore they must go lower down, much nearer to the Humid
Hollow, because the devils always hide themselves nearest
to the slough. Cipriano, however, bade dig where Grillo
advised; the spades grated, and soon there was an odour of
new-dug earth. Giovanni shuddered, for a bat had brushed
his face with its weird pinions; but Merula clapped him on the
shoulder, crying, 'Fear nothing, little monk! we shall find no
devil here. This Grillo is an ass. Thank heaven, it's not
the sort of excavation I'm used to. At Rome, in the 45th
Olympiad' (Merula scorned the Christian calendar), 'in the
days of Pope Innocent <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, diggers from Lombardy, who
were working on the Appian Way close to the tomb of
Cæcilia Metella, found an ancient sarcophagus with the
inscription, "Julia, daughter of Claudius," and in it a body
clothed in wax&mdash;a fair maid of fifteen, with the semblance of
one asleep. You would have sworn she breathed: the flush
of life was on her cheek. Multitudes flocked to the tomb
and refused to leave it; for such was Julia's beauty, as to be
incredible to those who had not beheld it. But it ill-suited
the Pope that his children should adore a dead heathen, and
he caused the body to be interred secretly under the Pincian
Hill. Do you take me, lad? That was something like
excavating!'</p>

<p>And Merula contemptuously kicked the clods which the
diggers were throwing up at his feet. Suddenly all the
onlookers started, for a jarring sound had come from one of
the spades.</p>

<p>'Bones!' said the gardener; 'the ancient burying-place was
here.'</p>

<p>At this moment the long-drawn howl of a dog was heard
from San Gervaso, and Giovanni thought, 'We are profaning
a grave. May it prove nothing worse!'</p>

<p>'Bones of a horse!' cried Strocco contemptuously, and
dragged out a mouldered, long-shaped skull.</p>

<p>'Grillo,' said Messer Cipriano anxiously, 'were it not
better we tried elsewhere?'</p>

<p>'Did I not say so?' cried Merula; and taking two of the
workmen with him he began new operations at the base of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
the hill. Strocco also had detached a party to dig in the
Humid Hollow.</p>

<p>Presently excited shouts were heard from Messer Giorgio.</p>

<p>'Hither all ye simpletons! Did not I know where ye
should dig?'</p>

<p>All ran to his side; but again the treasure proved naught;
the great man's marble fragment was only an ordinary stone.
They had all deserted Grillo, who, openly humiliated, was
digging alone by the light of a broken lantern.</p>

<p>The wind had fallen and the air grew warmer: out of the
Humid Hollow exhaled a mist. The breath of primroses
and violets mingled with the dankness of stagnant water.
Dawn was in the sky, and the cocks crowed for the second
time, signal of the departing of night.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the depths of the pit in which Grillo was
concealed there arose a despairing yell.</p>

<p>'Help! Help! I am falling! The ground has given
way!'</p>

<p>His lantern was extinguished, and at first nothing could be
seen. He was heard struggling and panting, groaning and
moaning. Lights were fetched, and disclosed the roof of a
subterranean vault broken through by Grillo's weight. Two
lads crept into the hole.</p>

<p>'Eh, Grillo! Where are you? Give us your hand! or are
you buried alive, poor fool?'</p>

<p>But Grillo seemed to have lost his voice. Heedless of a
sprained arm, he dragged himself along, kicking and struggling
most strangely. At last he burst into an ecstasy:&mdash;</p>

<p>'An idol! An idol! Hasten, Messer Cipriano! 'tis a
magnificent idol!'</p>

<p>'Idiot,' said Strocco, 'you have got the head of another
horse.'</p>

<p>'I tell you, No! There is but a hand missing. The rest
is perfect&mdash;feet, head, shoulders!' shouted Grillo beside
himself.</p>

<p>Then the labourers descended into the pit, carefully turning
over the brickwork ruins. Giovanni, stretched on the
ground, looked down into the vault, from which came the
chill of a grave, and the mouldy breath of long-covered
damp.</p>

<p>Messer Cipriano bade the men stand aside, and Giovanni
could see in the profundity between the walls of ancient red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
brick, a white and naked body which lay like a corpse upon
a bier, yet in the flaring of the torchlight seemed rosy and
warm with life.</p>

<p>'Venus!' cried Messer Giorgio: 'As I live, the Venus of
Praxiteles! I cry you honour, friend Cipriano! Not the
dukedoms of Milan or Genoa could bring you greater
felicity!'</p>

<p>As for Grillo, they dug him out; and though his face was
clotted with blood, and his arm had swelled into uselessness,
in his old eyes shone the pride of a conqueror.</p>

<p>'Grillo! friend! beloved! benefactor! And I scorned
you for a fool: and you&mdash;you are the cleverest of men!'
cried Messer Giorgio, and falling into his arms he kissed him
with deep emotion.</p>

<p>'Once,' he continued garrulously, 'Filippo Brunelleschi
found a Hermes in just such a vault under his own house.
Doubtless the pagans, knowing the value of these statues, hid
them from the fury of the Christians, who were exterminating
the old worship.'</p>

<p>Grillo listened, smiling beatifically, inattentive to the pipe
of the shepherd and the bleating of sheep. He saw not
that the sky shone now with a white and watery brilliance,
nor knew that from Florence the belfries were exchanging
their morning salutation.</p>

<p>'Gently! gently! To the right there! So! Keep it out
from the wall!' cried Messer Cipriano. 'Five silver pieces
to each, if you can get it out without breakage.'</p>

<p>By this time the stars had all disappeared with the exception
of the orb of Venus, which still sparkled like a diamond
in the glow of day. And slowly, slowly, with her ineffable
smile, the goddess herself arose&mdash;as once she had risen from
the foam of the sea, so now she ascended from her millennial
tomb in the darkness of the earth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Glory to thee, golden-limbed Aphrodite,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Delight of the gods and of mortals ...'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>declaimed Merula.</p>

<p>But Giovanni saw her face blanched in the illumination of
the white sunlight; and himself paling with terror, the boy
murmured, '<i>La Diavolessa bianca!</i>'</p>

<p>He rose up and would have fled; but wonder overcame
his fear. Not though he had known himself guilty of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
mortal sin which is punished with eternal fire, could he
have torn his gaze from that chaste and naked body, from
that countenance flaming with the effulgence of beauty.
Never in the days when Aphrodite was queen of the world
had any worshipped her with devouter trembling.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Suddenly from the little church of San Gervaso the bells
rang out, and the whole company turned and involuntarily
paused in their work, for in the morning stillness the sound
seemed irate and menacing.</p>

<p>'Lord have mercy on our souls!' murmured Grillo, putting
his hand to his head with a despairing gesture. 'Here is
Don Faustino, and a multitude with him! They have seen
us! Look how they beat their hands and beckon. See,
they rush upon us! I am a lost man!'</p>

<p>At this moment arrived those friends of Messer Cipriano's,
who had intended to have been present for the excavation, but
who had lost their way. Boltraffio threw a glance at them, and,
absorbed though he still was in the new-found goddess, his
attention was caught on the instant by one of the newcomers.
This personage was already inspecting the Venus, with a cold,
imperturbable composure, so different from Giovanni's personal
agitation, that the lad could not but be struck with
astonishment. He continued to gaze at the statue, but his
consciousness now was entirely for the man by his side.</p>

<p>'Hearken!' said Messer Cipriano after a few moments'
thought, 'the villa is not two paces distant, and the doors are
strong enough for a siege.'</p>

<p>'Yea, verily,' cried Grillo; 'courage, brothers, we shall save
her!' He felt jealous for the image which had cost him so
much, and directing the operations himself, he contrived to
get it safely transported across the Humid Hollow. Then the
statue was borne into the house; but scarcely had it crossed
the threshold, when on the hill-top appeared the threatening
figure, inflamed countenance and brandished arms of Don
Faustino.</p>

<p>The lower part of the villa was at present uninhabited, and
its great hall was used as a storehouse for agricultural implements
and great jars of olive-oil: in one corner was a mountain
of golden straw. Upon this straw, a humble, rustic bed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Aphrodite was delicately laid to rest. But this was no
sooner accomplished and the doors barred than the latter
were assailed by blows, by shouts, and by curses loud and
deep.</p>

<p>'Open! Open!' cried the cracked voice of Don Faustino;
'in the name of the true and living God, I bid you open!'</p>

<p>Messer Cipriano mounted the stone inner staircase and
surveyed the crowd from a grated window above the hall.
Seeing that the assailants were few, he entered into parley,
his face wearing his customary smile. But the priest put his
fingers in his ears, and vociferously demanded the idol&mdash;so
he named it&mdash;which had been dug out of the ground.</p>

<p>The Master of the Calimala now had recourse to a <i>ruse de
guerre</i>.</p>

<p>'Beware,' he said calmly; 'I have summoned the captain
of the town guard, and in two hours the horsemen will be on
you. I allow none to enter my house by force.'</p>

<p>'Break down the door,' cried the priest. 'God is with us.
Fear nothing! Assault!' And snatching an axe from a
gentle-faced old peasant beside him, he battered upon the
great door with all his strength.</p>

<p>'Don Faustino! Don Faustino!' cried the old man, feebly
restraining the furious ecclesiastic, 'we are poor folk, and we
do not dig up money in our fields. This will be our ruin; they
will have us to prison!'</p>

<p>The mention of the redoubtable town guard had struck
terror into the rabble; and many were already deserting.</p>

<p>'If it had been on the church-ground, 'twere another
matter,' muttered some of them.</p>

<p>'The confines established by law&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The law? A spider's web, set to catch flies, not hornets.
The law does not exist for great folk.'</p>

<p>'True for you. And every man is master on his own
land.'</p>

<p>All this time Giovanni was gazing at the rescued Venus.</p>

<p>The sunshine pouring through a side window seemed
waking the tender body to warmth and softness after its long
imprisonment in the gloom and the chill of the vault; the
golden straw surrounding it shone like an aureole.</p>

<p>Giovanni once more noted the stranger. He was on his
knees beside the statue, measuring it with his compasses, his
square, and a half-circle made of copper; on his face was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
the same imperturbable calm; in his cold, blue eyes the same
piercing curiosity.</p>

<p>'What is he doing? Who is he?' Giovanni asked himself,
almost awestruck, as he watched the quick, bold fingers
exploring the limbs of the goddess, the secrets of her beauty,
all the subtleties of the marble, too delicate for the apprehension
of the eye.</p>

<p>At the gate of the villa the priest was still heard yelling at
the melting crowd.</p>

<p>'Stay, rascals! Sellers of Christ! fearful of the town guard,
but careless of Antichrist! <i>Ipse vero Antichristus opes
malorum effodiet et exponet</i>, as said the great preacher St.
Anselm of Canterbury. <i>Effodiet</i>, hear you? Antichrist
shall dig up the old idols from the earth and again bring
them forth to the world.'</p>

<p>But none heeded him.</p>

<p>'He is a pestilent fellow, this Don Faustino of ours!' said
the prudent miller shaking his head; 'his life hangs by a
thread, yet see how he storms. For my part, I rejoice they
have found the treasure.'</p>

<p>'They say the image is of silver.'</p>

<p>'Silver? Nay, I saw it myself, and 'tis of marble; naked
and shameless.'</p>

<p>'Lord forgive us! Are we to soil our hands for such
rubbish as that?'</p>

<p>'Whither art going, Zacchello?'</p>

<p>'To the field; to my work.'</p>

<p>'God go with you! And I'll to the vineyard.'</p>

<p>At this all the fury of the priest was let loose on his
parishioners.</p>

<p>'Infidel dogs, abortions of Cain! would you abandon your
pastor? Know ye not, spawn of Satan, that did I not pray
for you day and night, and beat my breast with weeping and
fasting, your whole sinful village would long ere this have been
sunk into the earth? But it is ended! I leave you, shaking
off the dust from my feet. Cursed be the land! Cursed the
corn and the water and the flocks; and your sons and your
sons' sons. I am your father, your shepherd no more. I
renounce you! Anathema!'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>In the restored calm of the villa, where the goddess lay on
her golden bed, Giorgio Merula went up to the stranger who
was still measuring.</p>

<p>'You are studying the proportions of divinity?' said
the scholar patronisingly: 'You would reduce beauty to
mathematics?'</p>

<p>The other raised his eyes for an instant; then silently, as
if he had not heard the question, continued his work. The
compasses contracted and expanded, describing geometrical
figures; quietly and firmly the stranger put the angle measure
to the fair lips of Aphrodite&mdash;lips whose smile had struck
terror into Giovanni's heart&mdash;reckoned the result, and set it
in a note-book.</p>

<p>'Pardon my curiosity,' insisted Merula, 'how many divisions
are there?'</p>

<p>'This is a rough measurement,' said the unknown, unwillingly;
'generally I divide the human face into degrees,
minutes, seconds and thirds, each division being the twelfth
part of the preceding one.'</p>

<p>'Say you so?' cried Merula, 'meseems the last subdivision
must be less than the finest hair.'</p>

<p>'A third,' explained the other still grudgingly, 'is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>48823</sub> of
the whole face.'</p>

<p>Merula lifted his eyebrows with an incredulous smile.
'Well, we live and learn. I never thought it were possible to
reach such accuracy.'</p>

<p>'The more accurate the better,' returned his companion.</p>

<p>'Truly it may be so; yet, you know, in Art, in Beauty,
all these mathematical calculations&mdash;What artist in the
glow of enthusiasm, of fiery inspiration, breathed upon by
God&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' assented the unknown, evidently wearied;
'none the less I am anxious to know&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>And stooping he measured the distance from the roots of
the hair to the chin.</p>

<p>'To know?' thought Giovanni. 'Can one <i>know</i> these
matters? Folly! Does he not <i>feel</i>? understand?'</p>

<p>Merula, anxious to probe the other to the quick, talked
on of the ancients, and how they should be imitated. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
stranger waited till he had concluded, then said, smiling into
his long golden beard:&mdash;</p>

<p>'He who can drink from the fountain will not drink from
the cup.'</p>

<p>'By your leave!' shouted the scholar, 'if you call the
ancients a cup, whom do you call the fountain?'</p>

<p>'Nature,' said the unknown quietly.</p>

<p>And Merula presumptuously and provokingly continuing
to prate, he disputed no further, but assented with evasive
politeness. Only in his cold eyes weariness and reserve
became more manifest. At last Messer Giorgio, having
come to the end of his argument, was reduced to silence.
Then the other pointed out certain depressions in the marble,
which in no light could be detected by the sight, yet were
plain to the touch as the hand moved over the smooth
surface. '<i>Moltissime dolcezze</i>,' he called them; and then his
eye travelled over the figure, as if in one look he would
possess himself of its sum.</p>

<p>'And I who thought he did not feel!' said Giovanni to
himself. 'Yet if he feels, how can he measure and split it up
into numbers? Who is he, Messer Giorgio?' he whispered;
'tell me the name of this man?'</p>

<p>'Ha, little monk! is it you?' said Merula turning round;
'I had forgot you. Nay, but it is your idol: can it be that
you knew him not? It is Messer Leonardo da Vinci.'</p>

<p>And the historian presented Giovanni to the Master.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Through the perfect stillness of early morning in the
early spring, when the grass shone emerald between the
black olive-roots and the blue iris-flowers were motionless
on their slender stems, Giovanni and Leonardo, he on horseback,
the lad on foot, returned together to Florence.</p>

<p>'Is this really he?' thought Giovanni, watching him and
finding his minutest gesture interesting.</p>

<p>He was over forty. When silent and pensive his small,
keen, pale-blue eyes, under overhanging golden eyebrows,
seemed cold and piercing; yet when he talked they took
an expression of great good nature. The long, fair beard and
curling and luxuriant hair gave him an air of majesty. He
was tall and powerful in build, yet his face had a subtle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
charm which was almost feminine, and his thin high voice,
though pleasant, was not manly. His hand, reining a restive
steed, was very strong, yet it also was delicate, with long,
slender fingers like a woman's.</p>

<p>They were nearing the town walls; and the misty morning
sun shone upon the dome of the cathedral, and the quaint
tower of the Palazzo Vecchio.</p>

<p>'This is my opportunity,' thought Boltraffio. 'I must tell
him I would fain enter his studio as a pupil.'</p>

<p>Just then Leonardo checked his horse and fixed his eyes
on a young falcon circling slowly and easily in the air above
its quarry&mdash;some duck or heron in the reeds of the Mugnone's
bank. Presently, with a short cry, it dropped headlong, like
a stone, swooping down from the height and disappearing
behind the trees. Leonardo had followed it with his gaze,
not losing a single turn, a movement, a flap of the strong
wings; then he took his note-book from his girdle and jotted
down the result of his observation.</p>

<p>Boltraffio noticed that he held the pencil in his left hand;
and remembered strange tales he had heard of his writing in
a mysterious reversed hand only to be read in a mirror, from
right to left, as men write in the East. Some said he wrote
thus to make an enigma of his wicked heretical opinions
about nature and about God.</p>

<p>'Now or never!' Giovanni was saying to himself; but all
at once Antonio's harsh words flashed across his mind: '"Go
to him if you would lose your soul: he is a sinner and an
atheist."'</p>

<p>Smiling, Leonardo drew his attention to an almond-tree,
on the crest of a bare, wind-swept hill, very small, very
feeble, very solitary, yet already hopeful and joyous, and
decking itself with pale blossoms, which gleamed and glistened
against the azure of the sunlit sky.</p>

<p>Boltraffio could not admire it, for his heart was heavy and
perplexed. Then Leonardo, as if guessing at his disquietude,
spoke gentle words which the young man remembered long
afterwards.</p>

<p>'If you wish to be an artist, put away all grief and care
from your mind, save that for art itself. Let your soul be as
a mirror reflecting all objects, all colours, all movements, but
itself remaining ever clear and unmoved.'</p>

<p>They passed in through the gates of Florence.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Boltraffio went to the cathedral, where that morning Fra
Girolamo Savonarola was to preach. As he entered, the last
notes of the organ were dying away under the resounding
arches of Santa Maria del Fiore. The throng had filled
the church with suffocating heat and with the low rustlings
of unceasing small movements. Men, women, and children
were separated from each other by drawn curtains. Under
the arches, slender and narrow like arrow-heads, deep gloom
and mystery reigned as in a sleeping forest. The rays of
sunlight, refracted by brilliantly coloured glass, fell in rainbow
hues upon the congregation and upon the grey marble
of the pillars. The semi-darkness surrounding the altar was
broken by the glare of candles. Mass was over and the crowd
was awaiting the preacher. All looks were fixed on the
wooden pulpit.</p>

<p>Giovanni found a place in the crowd and listened to the
whisperings of his neighbours.</p>

<p>'Will he come soon?' was asked impatiently by a carpenter
of low stature, with a pale perspiring face and lank hair bound
by a fillet.</p>

<p>'God knows!' responded a tinker, big and red-faced, but
asthmatic. 'He has with him at San Marco a certain little
brother named Marufi, with a hunchback and a stammering
tongue, and 'tis he chooses the hour for his coming. We
waited four hours once, and had thought there would be no
preaching, yet in the end he came.'</p>

<p>'<i>Santo Dio Benedetto!</i> And I have waited since midnight!
I am blind for sleep and for want of a crumb in my mouth.
I could sit down upon knives!'</p>

<p>'Did I not tell thee, Damiano, 'twas matter of patience?
Even now we are so far from the pulpit we shall hear
naught.'</p>

<p>'Eh! We shall hear well enough. When he falls to at
his shouting and his thundering, not the deaf only but the
very dead must needs hear.'</p>

<p>'They say now, that he prophesies.'</p>

<p>'Not yet! Not till he has built Noah's Ark.'</p>

<p>'He has built it; to the last plank. Yea, and made a
parabolic description thereof. Its length, Faith; its breadth;
Charity; its altitude, Hope. Haste, he says, haste to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Ark of Salvation, while the doors stand wide. The day
cometh when the doors will be put to, and then many
shall weep that they have not repented and have not come
in time to enter within. To-day he preaches of the Flood,
the seventeenth verse of the sixth chapter of the book of
Genesis.'</p>

<p>'They say he has had another vision, War,
Pestilence!'</p>

<p>'The horsedealer in Vallombrosa said that a night or
two agone great hosts fought in the sky over the city,
and one could hear the clash of swords and the dinting of
armour.'</p>

<p>'And it is a certainty, good folk, that on the <i>Nunziata</i> in
the Chiesa dei Servi has been seen a bloody sweat.'</p>

<p>'Go to! And tears run nightly from the Madonna on the
Rubaconte bridge. Lucia, my aunt, saw it herself!'</p>

<p>'And it means no good, rest assured. The Lord have
mercy on us, miserable sinners!'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, among the women, there was a disturbance.
An old woman fainted, and when lifted up, still did not
recover her senses. The whole multitude indeed was worn
by the interminable waiting; the pale carpenter seemed
unable to sustain himself longer.</p>

<p>But suddenly a wave stirred the sea of heads, and a whisper
ran through the church.</p>

<p>'He is coming!'</p>

<p>'Nay, 'tis not he, 'tis Fra Domenico da Pescia.'</p>

<p>'I tell you, yea, 'tis he! He has come.'</p>

<p>Giovanni saw a man in the black and white Dominican
habit girdled with a rope, who slowly ascended the pulpit-stair
and removed his cowl. His face was emaciated and
yellow as wax, his lips thick, his nose aquiline, his forehead
low. His left hand fell weakly on the desk, his right he
raised clutching the crucifix; and silently with burning eyes
he looked upon the trembling and expectant crowd. Profound
silence reigned, in which each man could hear the
beating of his own heart. The eyes of the monk glowed
increasingly, till they were like fiery coals; but he still kept
silence, and the strain of waiting became unendurable. It
seemed that in another moment the crowd would burst into
screams.</p>

<p>Yet the calm became deeper, more awful; till suddenly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
rending the silence, came the terrible, lacerating, superhuman
cry of the friar:&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>Ecce ego adduco aquas super terram</i>, Behold I bring a
Flood upon the earth!'</p>

<p>A shudder passed through the crowd, raising the hair from
the head. Giovanni paled; he fancied the earth quaking, the
cathedral arches about to fall. Beside him the stalwart
tinker was shaking like a leaf, his teeth chattering. The
head of the feeble carpenter had sunk backward on his
shoulders as if he had received a blow, his face was shrivelled,
his eyelids closed.</p>

<p>What followed was not a sermon but a delirium, which
took hold of these thousands of people and shook them
as a storm shakes the withered leaves. Giovanni listened,
scarcely understanding. Detached phrases reached his
ear:&mdash;</p>

<p>'See ye, see how the heavens have already darkened; the
sun is purple, like clotted blood. Flee! Hide yourselves!
There cometh even now a rain of brimstone and fire; a hail
of fiery stones and thunderbolts. <i>Fuge O Sion quae habitas
apud filiam Babylonis!</i> O Italy, chastisement cometh upon
chastisement. After pestilence, war; and hunger after war!
Judgment is here, judgment is there! Everywhere there is
judgment. Among you the living suffice not to carry the
dead. The dead in your houses shall be so many that the
grave-diggers shall call to you to throw them out, and shall
heap them on carts, yea, to the very necks of the horses, and
shall throw them one upon the other and burn them. And
then again they shall go through the streets and cry, "Who
has any dead? Who has any dead?" And you will answer
them: "I throw to you my son, I throw to you my brother,
I throw to you my husband!" And then they shall go further,
and always they shall cry: "Bring forth your dead! bring
forth your dead!" O Florence! O Rome! O Italy! Past is
the time of songs and of feasting; ye are sickened unto death.
Lord, Thou art witness, that with my words I would have
averted this ruin! But I can no more. I have no words
more. I can but weep, and run over with my tears. Mercy!
Mercy! O merciful Lord! Alas! my poor people! Alas!
my Florence!'</p>

<p>He opened his arms, and the last words had sunk to a
scarcely audible whisper. They passed over the crowd and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
died away, like the rustle of wind in the leaves&mdash;a sigh of
infinite pity.</p>

<p>Pressing his white lips on the crucifix, he knelt and burst
into sobs. The sermon was ended. The slow, heavy organ-notes
rolled out, persuasive and immense, increasingly solemn
and terrible, like the sound of the mighty ocean.</p>

<p>A woman's voice cried <i>'Misericordia!</i>'</p>

<p>And thousands of voices answered, calling one to another;
and like corn stalks bowing before the wind, the people fell
upon their knees, line upon line, wave upon wave, crowding
upon, striking against each other, like a flock of sheep panic-struck
at the advance of a storm; and the long, agonising wail
of penitents upon whom pressed the terror of immediate
ruin, rose to Heaven, mingling with the pealing of music,
shaking the ground, the marble pillars, and the vaults of the
cathedral.</p>

<p>'<i>Misericordia! Misericordia!</i>'</p>

<p>Giovanni also sank to his knees, sobbing. The tall tinker
rolled against him, breathing hard; the pale carpenter caught
his breath and cried like a child, moaning&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>Misericordia!</i>'</p>

<p>And Boltraffio remembered his pride, and his love of life,
his desire to escape from Fra Benedetto, and to give himself
up to the dangerous arts of Messer Leonardo, the enemy of
God; he recalled the past fearful night on the Hill of the
Mill, the recovered Venus, his sinful enthusiasm for the
heathen beauty of the 'White She-devil'; stretching forth
his hands to heaven, he mingled his voice with that of the
despairing crowd, and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>'Lord! Lord! have compassion on me! I have sinned
before thee. Pardon, and have mercy.'</p>

<p>At that moment, raising his face, wet with tears, he saw at
his side the tall, upright form of Leonardo da Vinci. The
artist, leaning carelessly against a column, held in his right
hand his unfailing sketch-book; with his left he was drawing;
now and then he glanced at the pulpit as if hoping to see
once more the head of the preacher.</p>

<p>A stranger, and surrounded by the terrified crowd,
Leonardo maintained a superb composure. In his cool,
blue eyes, on his thin lips, tightly compressed like those of a
man of minute observation, there was the same aloofness
and curiosity with which he had mathematically measured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
the body of the Aphrodite. At sight of him the tears dried
in Giovanni's eyes, and the prayer was silenced upon his lips.</p>

<p>Leaving the church he followed the artist and asked
permission to see his sketch. Leonardo demurred, but
presently handed the boy his sketch-book. And Giovanni saw
a frightful caricature; not Savonarola, but an old and hideous
devil in the dress of a monk, like the preacher indeed, but
as if disfigured by self-inflicted and torturing penance, his
pride and his desires still unsubdued. The lower jaw protruded,
wrinkles intersected the cheek, the neck was twisted
and black as a mummy's, the bushy, beetling brows, the rabid
glance scarce preserved a semblance of humanity. All that
was dark, terrible, and superstitious, all which gave Savonarola
into the power of the deformed, tongue-tied visionary Marufi,
was expressed by Leonardo in this sketch; brought out
with neither anger nor pity, but with an imperturbable and
impartial clear-sightedness.</p>

<p>And Giovanni remembered his words: '<i>L'ingegno dell'
pittore vuol essere a similitudine dello specchio</i>. The genius
of the painter should be as a mirror, reflecting all objects,
and colours, and movements, itself ever transparent and
serene.'</p>

<p>The pupil of Benedetto raised his eyes to the artist's
face, and felt that though threatened by eternal damnation,
though he were to find in Messer Leonardo a veritable servant
of Antichrist, yet to leave him had become impossible; an
irresistible force was drawing him to this man; woe unto him
if he failed to penetrate into the very depths of this being and
of his art.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>X</h3>

<p>Two days later, Messer Cipriano having been detained by
affairs in Florence, and unable to arrange for the transport of
the Venus, Grillo burst in upon him with most unwelcome
tidings. Don Faustino, it seemed, had left San Gervaso
and betaken himself to San Maurizio, the neighbouring
village. Here, having terrified the people with talk of the
chastisement of Heaven, he had collected a party by night,
besieged the villa, broken in the doors, thrashed Strocco the
gardener, who had been left in charge of the statue, and
bound him hand and foot. Then the priest had recited over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
the goddess an ancient prayer called '<i>Oratio super effigies
vasaque in loco antiqua reperta</i>,' in which the servant of the
Church asks God to purify all statuary, vessels, and other
objects dug out of the ground, and to convert them to the
profit of Christian souls, to the glory of the Trinity, '<i>ut, omni
immunditia depulsa, sint fidelibus tuis utenda per Christum
dominum nostrum</i>.' Then they broke up the statue of the
goddess, cast the fragments into a furnace, made of them a
cement, and with it daubed the new-raised wall of the village
cemetery.</p>

<p>As he told this tale the old man wept for grief. But the
event helped Giovanni Boltraffio to a decision. That very
day he presented himself before Messer Leonardo and begged
to be received as a pupil. Leonardo accepted him.</p>

<p>A little later, tidings were brought to Florence that
Charles <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, Most Christian King of France, had taken the
field with a countless host for the conquering of the Two
Sicilies, and probably also of Rome and Florence. Panic
spread among the citizens. They perceived that the prophecy
of Savonarola was being fulfilled. Punishment was at their
door! The sword of the Lord was drawn upon Italy!

<p>'If the eagle can sustain himself in the rarest atmosphere,
if great ships by sails can float across the waves, why cannot
likewise Man, by means of powerful wings, make himself lord
of the winds, and rise, the conqueror of space?'</p>

<p>Leonardo found these words in one of his old note-books,
written five years earlier with the buoyancy of hope. Opposite
was the sketch of a machine; a beam, to which by means of
iron rods, were attached wings to be moved by cords and
pulleys. Now the apparatus seemed to him clumsy and
absurd.</p>

<p>His new machine was like an enormous bat. The body
of the wings was formed by five wooden fingers, like a
skeleton hand, with many joints and pliant articulations.
Tendons and muscles connecting these fingers were formed
by strips of tanned leather and laces of raw silk. The wing
rose by means of a crank and a moveable piston, and
was covered by impermeable taffeta. It resembled the
webbed foot of a goose. There were four wings moving in
turn like the legs of a horse. Their length was forty <i>braccia</i>,
their spread, eight. They bent backward for propulsion, and
dropped to make the machine rise. A man was to sit in
it astride, and with his feet in stirrups was to move the
wings by a machinery of cords, blocks, and levers. A great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
rudder, feathered like the tail of a bird, was to be turned by
his head.</p>

<p>But a bird, before the first flap of his wings carries him from
the earth, must first raise himself by his feet. The short-legged
swift, for instance, if placed upon the ground struggles
but cannot fly. Therefore in the machine two cane stilts
were indispensable, although their inelegance greatly disturbed
the inventor. Perfection could not exist without
beauty. He plunged into calculations, hoping to lay his
finger on a blunder. Failing, he impatiently drew a pencil
across a whole page of figures and wrote on the margin&mdash;</p>

<p>'Incorrect'; and presently, '<i>Satanasso!</i>' He was enraged.</p>

<p>Then he recommenced; but his calculations became more
and more confused, and the scarce perceptible error grew
increasingly distinct, as he worked on and on by the light of
a flickering candle which offended his eyes.</p>

<p>Then his cat, suddenly waking, leaped on the work-table,
stretched himself, humped his back, and began to play with
a moth-eaten scarecrow of a stuffed bird dangling from a
wooden perch&mdash;a contrivance for studying the centre of
gravity in the act of flight. The inventor pushed the cat
angrily away, nearly knocking him down and causing a
plaintive mewing.</p>

<p>'Bless your heart! you may go where you like so long as
you don't interfere with me,' said Leonardo apologetically,
rubbing the smooth, black fur which emitted electric sparks.
The cat purred, sat down majestically, doubling his velvet
paws under him, and fixing on his master steady green eyes
full of self-satisfaction and mystery.</p>

<p>Once more figures, fractions, brackets, equations, cubic and
square roots appeared upon the paper. It was the second
night he had passed without sleep; for a whole month since
his return from Florence he had scarcely set foot outside
the house, but had worked unceasingly at the flying-machine.</p>

<p>The branches of a white acacia intruded through an open
window, and sometimes cast on the table their tender, odorous
blossoms. The moonlight, softened by a mist of clouds,
tinted like mother-o'-pearl, flooded the chamber, and mingled
with the murky illumination from the tallow candle. The
room was choked with machinery and instruments, astronomical,
physical, chemical, mechanical, and anatomical.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Wheels, levers, springs, screws, chimneys, pistons, arcs, suction-tubes,
brass, steel, iron, and glass, like the limbs of half-seen
monsters or colossal insects, peered out of the darkness.
There was a diving-bell, beside it the dulled crystal of an
optical apparatus resembling a great eye; then the skeleton
of a horse, a stuffed crocodile, a human abortion preserved in
spirit, a pair of boat-shaped shoes for walking on the water,
and lastly, the clay head of a child or of an angel, strayed
hither from the sculptor's studio, and smiling slyly and
mournfully at its surroundings. In the background was a
crucible and blacksmith's bellows, and coals lay red upon
the ashes of a furnace. Gigantic wings, one still bare, the
other already invested with its membrane, were spread out
over all the room, dominating the whole from floor to ceiling.
And sprawling on the ground, with nodding head, lay a man,
Zoroastro, Leonardo's assistant, who had fallen asleep at his
post, oil flowing from the blackened brass ladle which he
held in his hand. One of the wings touched the chest of the
sleeper, and was softly vibrating as he breathed; it seemed
alive, and its sharp upper end rustled against the rafters of
the ceiling.</p>

<p>In the uncertain light the machine, with this man between
its extended and moving wings, was like some stupendous
vampire ready to rise and fly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Gardens surrounded Leonardo's house outside Milan&mdash;between
the fortress and the Convent of Santa Maria delle
Grazie&mdash;and thence came a fine perfume of fruits and herbs,
thyme, and bergamot, and fennel. The moon had set.
Swallows under the windows were twittering and preparing
to fly, ducks splashed and quacked in the neighbouring pond.
The candle was dying in its socket; voices of the pupils were
heard from the studio hard by.</p>

<p>The students were two, Giovanni Boltraffio and Andrea
Salaino. Giovanni was copying an anatomical figure, and
sitting before a contrivance for the study of perspective&mdash;a
wooden frame with a string network which corresponded with
lines traced on the drawing-paper: Salaino was fitting a slab
of alabaster to a wooden panel. He was a pretty lad with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
innocent eyes and fair curls, petted by the Master, who drew
his angels from him.</p>

<p>'How think you, Andrea?' asked Boltraffio, 'will Messer
Leonardo soon finish this machine?'</p>

<p>'God knows!' answered Salaino whistling, and settling
the embroidered flaps of his new slippers. 'Last year he sat
two months at it and nothing resulted but laughter. That
crooked bear Zoroastro set himself to fly at all hazards. The
master forbade him, but he did it. The fool hung himself
all round with a necklace of bullock's bladders, lest he should
break anything if he fell; then he mounted the roof, flapped
his wings; and true it is he rose, but God wot 'twas the wind
carried him, and presently he turned topsy-turvy and fell plump
on to a dunghill; by the Lord's mercy 'twas soft and he broke
no bones, but the bladders burst with a roar like a cannon, the
daws in the belfry fled away for very terror, and there lay the
new Icarus kicking the air, on his head in the manure.'</p>

<p>Just then the third pupil entered, Cesare da Sesto, a man
no longer young; sickly, and splenetic, with malicious but
intelligent eyes. He had a sandwich in one hand, wine in
the other.</p>

<p>'Peuh! the sour stuff!' he said frowning and spitting,
'and the ham, by my troth, is boot-leather&mdash;yet one pays
two thousand ducats annually for these delicacies!'</p>

<p>'Try the other cask from under the pantry stair.'</p>

<p>'I have tried it. Of the two 'tis the worse;' then pointing
to Salaino's new plum-coloured and gaily-feathered cap, he
added, 'Oho! oho! some of us, it seems, get new things.
But 'tis the second month since they got any new ham in the
kitchen. Of a certainty things are well managed here! We
lead dog's lives. Marco vows on the bones of his mother
that the master has not one <i>soldo</i> left in the bag. He has
squandered everything on these cursed wings of his, and
begins his sparing by starving us. But I'll teach you where
else his money goes. In gifts for his darlings, in medals and
velvet caps. Have you no shame, Andrea, to receive alms?
Is Messer Leonardo your father or your brother? or are you
still a baby?'</p>

<p>'Cesare,' interrupted Giovanni, to give a new turn to the
discourse, 'you made promise to expound me the axioms of
perspective. We waste time expecting the master, who is
overstudious of his machine&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
'Ay, ay, my friend. We shall all be confounded some
day by that machine, devil take it! And if it is not this
machine 'tis another. I remember how in the very middle
of the <i>Cenacolo</i>, the Master, forsooth, must needs break
off to invent a new mincing-machine for sausages; and the
head of St. James could not get stuck on his shoulders,
because Leonardo was dissatisfied with the blades of the
cutter. And the best of his Madonnas had to wait in the
corner, while he devised a spit for the roasting of sucking-pigs.
And what think you of that his other grand discovery, the
lye of fowl's-dung for the washing of linen? There is no folly
for which Messer Leonardo will not sacrifice his time if he
can but get away from his paint-brush;' and Cesare's face
puckered itself, and his lips curled in a malicious laugh.</p>

<p>'Why, I pr'ythee, why does God give genius to such men?'
he added in a low, trembling voice.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Leonardo was still at work, bending over his writing-table.
A swallow flew in at the window and wheeled about the room,
brushing against the ceiling and the walls, till caught by the
great bat, its little, living wings fast held by the network of
artificial tendons. Cautiously Leonardo rose and delicately
freed the prisoner, took it in his hand, kissed the silky black
head, and let it fly away. The swallow soared, and was lost
in the blue air, screaming its cries of joy.</p>

<p>'How simple, how easy its flight,' he thought, as he followed
it with disappointed, envious eyes. He threw a contemptuous
glance at his machine, the dark skeleton of that tremendous
bat.</p>

<p>The man who was lying on the floor suddenly awoke. He
was a Florentine, a skilful mechanic and smith, by name
Zoroastro, or more shortly, Astro da Paretola. A clumsy
giant, with the simple face of a child, always covered with
soot and grime, he looked a Cyclops, for he had but one eye,
the other having been long ago destroyed by a spark from
some blazing metal.</p>

<p>Rubbing his single orb and scratching his shaggy head he
cried, 'The devil take me for a blockhead! Master, why
did you not hinder me from slumbering? I who was so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
zealously affected, who only thought how to hurry the evening
that the morning and the flying might come!'</p>

<p>'You were wise to sleep,' said Leonardo, 'for the wings
have failed.'</p>

<p>'What! these also? Nay, master, but I will not make
your machine again. Think of the money, the labour we
have thrown to the wind! What better can you want? Not
to fly, on wings like those, would be impossible! An elephant
could rise on them. Pr'ythee, master, let me try! I will
prove them over water, and then if I fall I'll come off with
no worse than a bathing. I can swim as a fish; I wasn't born
to be drowned.'</p>

<p>And he clasped his hands supplicatingly. Leonardo,
however, shook his head.</p>

<p>'Patience, friend, have yet patience. It will come in its
own time, and then&mdash;'</p>

<p>'<i>Then?</i>' cried the smith, almost in tears. 'Why not <i>now</i>?
Of a surety, master, as true as God is in heaven, I shall
fly.'</p>

<p>'No, Astro, fly thou wilt not. By a mathematical law&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I could have sworn you would say that! To the devil
with your mathematical laws, for they upset everything.
And to think of the years we have laboured! I am sick to
remember it! Every gnat, mosquito, fly, I pray you license&mdash;every
<i>muck</i>-fly, every <i>dunghill</i>-fly&mdash;has its wings; and men
crawl like worms. 'Tis rank injustice! And why should we
doubt? There they are, your wings, ready, and beautiful;
ready to be blessed of God, and spread, and to be off!
And then we shall see what we shall see!'</p>

<p>He paused, seemed to recall something, and continued
more calmly:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I would tell you a thing, master. This very night I
dreamed, nay, but I dreamed&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I conceive you! You flew.'</p>

<p>'Ay. But how? Hear me. I stood in a chamber,
where I know not, and amid a throng. They looked at me
and pointed, and then they laughed. And I said to myself,
"cursed spite 'twill be if I fly not." So I got up and I shook
my arms and I rose; I warrant you 'twas hard, as though I
would raise a mountain on my back! But 'twas soon lighter,
and I rose till my head was in the roof. And they cried
aloud, Behold him! he flieth! Ay, and I passed through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
the window like yon bird, and I circled higher and yet
higher, till I touched the sky. And the wind whistled in my
ears, and I laughed for very joy. "Why," I questioned
of myself, "did I never fly till now? 'Tis mighty easy; and
there is no call for any machinery at all."'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Shouts, oaths, and the quick thump of footsteps interrupted
them. The door was flung wide, and a fiery-haired,
freckle-faced man, dragging a child of ten by the ear, burst
into the chamber. It was Leonardo's pupil, Marco
d'Oggione.</p>

<p>'May the Lord send you an ill Easter!' he shouted;
'Rascal, I will set my heels upon your throat!'</p>

<p>'What coil is this, Marco?' asked Leonardo.</p>

<p>'I pray you listen, Master. This same young rogue has
filched my silver buckles; ten florins each did they cost me!
One he has gambled away at his dice; the other I have
found in his stocking. I did but pull him by the hair, and
now, son of the devil that he is, he hath bitten my finger to
the bone.'</p>

<p>And he would again have attacked the little lad by his
curls had not Leonardo rescued him. Then Marco, who
kept the keys of the house, took them from his pouch and
flung them on the ground.</p>

<p>'Take them up, sir! I will be warden no longer. I live
no longer in the house with rascals and with thieves!'</p>

<p>'Peace, Marco, peace; and leave this babe to me.'</p>

<p>The other three now came from the studio, and presently
Maturina, the fat cook, squeezed herself into the group,
carrying her market basket. Seeing the little sinner, she
flung up her hands and gabbled with the monotony of dry
peas pouring through a broken bag. Cesare talked also
volubly, demanding why this 'pagan of a Jacopo' was
allowed to stay, for the playing of every malicious and spiteful
trick capable of invention; had he not maimed the
watch-dog, stoned the nests of the swallows, torn wings from
butterflies?</p>

<p>Jacopo had taken refuge with the Master, his pale pretty
face quite impassive, his eyes, sinister in their brilliance,
turned to Leonardo with mute supplication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Leonardo would have appeased the tumult, but on his face
sat a strange air of perplexity and weakness, not lost upon
the contemptuous Cesare.</p>

<p>Presently the noise subsided of itself; and then Leonardo,
with his customary calm, called Giovanni and invited him to
an inspection of the <i>Cenacolo</i>, the Last Supper; his greatest
work. Giovanni flushed with pleasure, and they went
together.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>V</h3>

<p>However they paused by the courtyard fountain that
Leonardo, after his sleepless night, might refresh himself by
bathing his face. The day was cloudy, but windless, and
over all things streamed an argent light which seemed to
come from under water; days like these pleased the artist
best for painting. They were still at the well when the boy
Jacopo crept up, bearing in his hands a little case made of
bark.</p>

<p>'Messer Leonardo,' he murmured, 'I have brought it&mdash;for
you,' and cautiously raising the lid he showed a huge imprisoned
spider. 'I have watched it this three days,' he said
enthusiastically; ''tis poisonous! And 'tis a terror to see
how he devoureth flies!'</p>

<p>His face was radiant now, and catching a fly he gave it to
the captive. The spider seized the victim with its hairy legs,
and there was a fight and great buzzing.</p>

<p>'He sucks it! He sucks it!' cried the child in an ecstasy;
and Leonardo bent over the struggling creatures to watch.</p>

<p>It seemed to Giovanni that on the two so different faces
was the same expression: a hideous pleasure in the horrible.</p>

<p>When the fly had been murdered and devoured the boy
closed the little box, and said, 'I will put it on your table,
Messer Leonardo; you will like to see how he fights with
other spiders.'</p>

<p>Then he raised supplicating eyes, and went on with
quivering lips, 'Messere, be not wroth with me. I will go
from you. I see that I am a trouble to you; you are good,
but those others are evil; as truly am I also&mdash;I who understand
not pretending, as do they! So be it; I will go very
far away, and will live alone. 'Twill be better so. Only do
thou pardon me, Master, I pray, I supplicate. Pardon thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
me.' And great tears shone on the child's long lashes as he
went on. 'Pardon me, Master Leonardo, and I will leave
you the spider for a remembrance of me. Spiders live many
years; and I will ask Astro to feed it.'</p>

<p>'Whither would you go, poor child? Nay, Marco shall
forgive thee; I am not wroth with thee, and truly I will
accept thy spider. In the future, little one, seek to live
harmlessly.'</p>

<p>Jacopo turned his eyes to his Master, and in them was no
gratitude, only unbounded astonishment; and Leonardo
smiled at him, as if in his great wisdom he understood the
child, and knew him one of those innocent in their wrong
doing, because by nature formed for evil.</p>

<p>'It grows late, Giovanni; let us go on,' said Leonardo;
and together they trod the silent street which presently led
them between the walls of gardens, vineyards, and orchards,
to the convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Boltraffio had for some time been distressed by the fact
that he could no longer pay his master the monthly fee of
six florins which had been arranged. His uncle had quarrelled
with him, and now refused him further assistance, and
Fra Benedetto, who had lent him the means for two months,
could do no more.</p>

<p>So this morning Giovanni determined to explain matters to
his master. He turned deprecatingly to him, and reddening
to the roots of his hair, stammered:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Messere, we are at the 14th of the month, and it was
agreed I should pay you on the 10th. It irks me to confess
it, but I have no more than these three florins. Would you
consent to wait? Soon I have hope to get money. Merula
has promised me copying.'</p>

<p>Leonardo looked at him astonished.</p>

<p>'What speech is this, Giovanni? Are you not ashamed?'</p>

<p>By his disciple's blush, by his confusion, by his patched
shoes and threadbare clothes he guessed that Giovanni was
very poor. So he frowned, and talked of something else;
but presently took occasion to hand the boy a gold piece,
saying carelessly, 'Lad, go buy me twenty sheets of the blue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
paper for my drawings, and a parcel of red chalk, and
another of badger brushes. Take the money.'</p>

<p>'A ducat? to pay a matter of ten <i>soldi</i>? I will bring you
the surplus.'</p>

<p>'By no means. I care not for such trifles. Some day,
perchance, you will be able to pay it back. And talk no
more to me of money: do you hear?'</p>

<p>He went on at once to remark on the misty outlines of the
larch trees along both banks of the straight canal called the
Naviglio Grande, which carried the eye into the distance by
their long rows.</p>

<p>'Have you observed, Giovanni, that in a light mist the
trees show blue, in a thick mist, grey?'</p>

<p>And he talked further of the shadows thrown by the clouds
upon the hills, one tone in summer when their trees are
in leaf, another in winter when their trees are bare. Then
he said abruptly.</p>

<p>'You have thought me a skinflint because on our first
coming to terms you saw me note every detail of the bargain
in a book. I caught that trick from my good father, Piero,
the notary, who knows his way in affairs passing well. But
the habit is an idle one for me. I am extreme to mark
trifles such as the price of the feather in Salaino's cap; yet
thousands of ducats go from me, and I know not whither.
For the future, boy, regard not this trick. If thou hast
need of money, take it; and be sure I give it to thee as a
father gives to a son.'</p>

<p>And Leonardo looked at him with a smile so tender, that
the pupil's heart was lightened and overflowed with joy.
Then again the master talked of trees, and pointing to a
misshapen white mulberry, bade his disciple observe that not
only every tree but also every leaf has its own figure different
from its fellows, even as every son of man has his own face.
It seemed to Giovanni that he spoke of trees with no less
insight than he had shown in speaking of his needy disciple;
as though loving observation of all things living had
sharpened his eye to the penetration of a seer and a clairvoyant.</p>

<p>They were now in sight of Santa Maria delle Grazie, the
church belonging to the Dominican convent; a brick edifice
with a broad dome like a tent&mdash;the early work of Bramante.
It rose from the plain behind a grove of dark mulberry trees,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
and seemed rosy and gay against its background of white and
rainy clouds.</p>

<p>The pair passed at once into the convent refectory.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>It was a long bare hall, whitewashed, and with a roof of
wooden rafters. There was a smell of damp, of incense, and
of fast-day fare. The Father Superior had his dining-board in
the recess by the entrance; on either side were the long narrow
tables for the monks. So still was it that the buzz of the flies
was audible in the windows, glazed with small, yellow, and
dusty panes, and hollowed like the cells of a honeycomb.
Now and then voices came from the kitchen with a clatter of
iron saucepans.</p>

<p>Opposite the prior's table, at the end of the hall, there rose
a scaffolding of wood covered with coarse grey linen; Giovanni
divined that behind it was the <i>magnum opus</i>, upon which the
Master had already laboured for twelve years; the <i>Cenacolo</i>,
the Last Supper.</p>

<p>Leonardo having ascended the scaffold and opened a
wooden case which contained his sketches, cartoons, paints,
etc., took a small, well-worn, much-annotated Latin book, and
handing it to Giovanni, bade him read the thirteenth chapter
of St. John. Then he removed the covering from the fresco.</p>

<p>Giovanni's first impression was that he saw not a painting
but a prolongation of the room itself against an actual background
of air. Another chamber seemed to have opened out
behind the withdrawn curtain; the beams of the ceiling
passed on into it, contracting in the distance, and the light of
day was blended in the quiet evening light above the hills of
Zion, which glowed through the triple window. This second
supper-room was little less austere and bare than the convent
refectory. Though more solemn, the sacred table, with
its cups, plates, knives, and flagons, was like the board at
which the monks nightly supped; the cloth with its narrow
stripes, its knotted corners, its unsmoothed folds, seemed
still damp, as if but just taken from the convent linen room.</p>

<p>Giovanni opened the Gospel and read:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew
that his hour was come that he should depart out of this
world unto the Father, ... and supper being ended, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
devil having put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's
son, to betray him....</p>

<p>'Jesus was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, Verily
verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. Then the
disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.
Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples
whom Jesus loved.'</p>

<p>Giovanni again raised his eyes to the fresco. The faces of
the apostles were so animated that he seemed to hear their
speech, to look into the depths of their souls, confounded
as they were by the most mysterious, the most terrible of all
catastrophes that have ever taken place&mdash;the birth of that
sin by which God was to die.</p>

<p>Specially was he impressed by Judas, by St. Peter, and
St. John. The head of Judas was not yet painted, and the
body, bent backward, but dimly outlined. Clutching desperately
at the bag with convulsive fingers, he had overturned
the salt-cellar, and the salt was spilled. Peter, impetuous in
his wrath, was starting up from behind, a knife still in his
right hand, his left on the shoulder of John, as if asking
the beloved disciple 'of whom doth He speak?' With his
silver hair, with his splendid resentment, his whole frame
showed that fiery zeal, that thirst for great deeds, with which,
upon understanding the ineluctable sufferings of his Master
he was to cry 'Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I
will lay down my life for thy sake!' John, on the contrary,
with his long silken tresses, his eyelids lowered as if in
the peace of sleep, his folded hands, the long oval of his
face&mdash;seemed the ideal of calm and heavenly serenity.
Alone among the disciples he knew no suffering, no fear, no
wrath.</p>

<p>Giovanni saw, and he said to himself, 'Here is the true
Leonardo! And I had doubted and wellnigh believed the
calumnies. The man impious who created that? Nay, who
among men is closer to Christ than he?'</p>

<p>The painter, meantime, having completed the face of John
with delicate touches of the brush, began the charcoal outline
of the head of Jesus. Vainly, however; he had meditated
upon that head for ten years, yet still he could not
accomplish even the first sketch. Always when confronted by
that emptiness where the divine countenance should appear,
the artist trembled with mortal anguish and the sense of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
own impotence. Throwing the charcoal aside, passing a cloth
over the few lines he had lightly traced, he fell into one of
those reveries which sometimes lasted for entire hours.
Giovanni ventured to approach him, and saw his face as it
were aged, severe, wearing the imprint of unremitting tension,
of silent despair.</p>

<p>Yet, his eyes falling on those of his pupil, Leonardo said
kindly&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, then, <i>amico mio</i>, what say you of it?'</p>

<p>'What words have I, Master? It is beautiful, with a
beauty beyond aught in this world. None other has so
understood that scene! But nay, I will not speak&mdash;I
cannot.'</p>

<p>His voice shook with tears; but presently he added in a
low voice, 'One thing I would ask. Among such faces, what
can be the face of Judas?'</p>

<p>The master, without answering, handed him a paper sketch.
It showed a face terrible but not repulsive, not wicked even,
but big with infinite grief, with the profound bitterness of
great knowledge.</p>

<p>Giovanni compared it with that of St. John. 'Yes,' he
exclaimed awestruck; 'it is he! He of whom it is said,
Satan entered into him; who perhaps knew more than any
of them, but who would not accept the cry, that 'all may
be one!' because he desired to be <i>an one</i> by himself.'</p>

<p>He was interrupted by Cesare da Sesto, who burst into the
refectory, followed by a man in the court livery.</p>

<p>'At last! at last!' he cried; 'Master, we have sought you
in every place! The duchess requires you&mdash;on a grave
matter.'</p>

<p>'Your Worship will have the kindness to come with me to
the palace,' said the servant.</p>

<p>'What is the cause?'</p>

<p>'A disaster, Messer Leonardo. The water pipes do not
work; and this morning when Her Excellence was pleased
to get into her bath, and her woman had gone to the adjoining
chamber for linen, the tap broke, so that Her Excellence
was nearly scalded. She is pleased to be very wroth; and
Messer Ambrogio Ferrari, the steward, complains greatly,
and saith he hath more than once warned your Worship
about these pipes.'</p>

<p>'What puerility is this?' replied Leonardo; 'can you not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
see I am at work? Go to Zoroastro. In half an hour he
will repair everything.'</p>

<p>'Messere, I was told not to return without your Worship.'</p>

<p>Leonardo, however, went back to his picture. But when
his eye fell on the blank space destined for the Saviour's
head, his brows knit with discouragement, and, realising fresh
failure, he descended from the easel.</p>

<p>'Well, we will go. You, Giovanni, come for me to the
outer courtyard of the castle, Cesare will show you the way;
I will expect you by the <i>Cavallo</i>.'</p>

<p>By this name he spoke of his great equestrian statue of
Francesco Sforza.</p>

<p>And to Giovanni's amazement, without another glance at
the <i>Cenacolo</i>, the Master followed the scullion to mend the
pipes of the ducal bath.</p>

<p>'So you can't take your eyes off the thing?' said Cesare
mockingly to Boltraffio; 'certes, 'tis a wonderful work; at
least until one sees through it.'</p>

<p>'What is your meaning?'</p>

<p>'Ask me not. I won't spoil your faith. Mayhap in the
end you will discover for yourself. Meanwhile, admire.'</p>

<p>'Cesare, tell me your thought.'</p>

<p>'Good, then. Only be not wroth at the truth. I know
all you will find to say and I will not dispute with you. In
good sooth, it is wonderful. No master hath so much
anatomy, such perspective, such science of chiaroscuro.
I challenge it not. All is direct from nature, the face
wrinkles, the folds in the cloth, everything. But the living
spirit, where is that? the God is absent; and will absent
Himself for ever. At bottom, in the soul, all is ice and
death! Look, Giovanni! use your eyes! See the geometrical
regularity; four triangles, two contemplative, two
active; and their centre is Christ. Look narrowly. On
the right you have perfect goodness in John, perfect badness
in Judas, the dividing of good and evil (that is, justice)
in Peter. Beside them the active triad, Andrew, James, and
Bartholomew. Now turn to the left; another contemplative
triangle; the love of Philip, the faith of James, the
wisdom of Thomas; then again, activity in another triad.
Not inspiration, Giovanni, but geometry; mathematics in the
seat of beauty. All calculated, reasoned <i>ad nauseam</i>, tested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
to repulsion, weighed in the balance, measured by the compasses.
Under the holy things&mdash;contempt.'</p>

<p>'Cesare, Cesare!' cried Giovanni with gentle reproof. 'How
little you know the Master! Why do you hate him?'</p>

<p>'And you think perchance you know him, and therefore
you love him?' returned Cesare quickly, turning to his companion
with a bitter smile. In his eyes blazed such unextinguishable
malice that Giovanni instinctively averted his
own.</p>

<p>'You are unjust, Cesare,' he resumed after a pause; 'the
picture is incomplete; the Christ is not yet there.'</p>

<p>'And will He be there? Do you expect it? Well, we
shall see. Only mark you my words. I say Messer Leonardo
will never finish the <i>Cenacolo</i>; never paint the Judas, nor the
Christ! For, see you, my friend, one may do much by
mathematics and by experiments in science; but not everything.
More is needed. There is a limit which he, with all
his learning, can never pass.'</p>

<p>They left the monastery and moved towards the Castello di
Porta Giovia. Boltraffio was long silent, then he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>'In one point, Cesare, you certainly are in error. The
Judas exists already; I have seen it.'</p>

<p>'When? Where?'</p>

<p>'Just now&mdash;in the convent. He showed me the drawing.'</p>

<p>'You?'</p>

<p>Cesare stared, then said slowly, and as if by an effort.</p>

<p>'How was it? Good?'</p>

<p>Giovanni nodded; and Cesare after this kept silence.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Arrived at the castle gates, they crossed the drawbridge to
the Torre del Filarete, which looked to the south, and was
deeply moated. Here even at noon it was dark; and the air
was laden with an undefinable odour of barracks&mdash;the smell
of stables, straw, and sour bread. Under the resounding
arches came echoes of the laughter and curses of the hired
foreign soldiery.</p>

<p>Cesare had the pass; but Giovanni was regarded with
mistrust, and his name entered in the guard-book. Crossing
a second drawbridge, where they submitted to a second examination,
they reached the deserted inner court of the castle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
called the Piazza d'Arme. Straight before them was the stern
Torre di Bona; to the right, the entrance to the Corte Ducale;
to the left, the Rocchetta, a veritable eagle's nest, the part of
the castle most difficult of access. In the centre of the square,
surrounded by ill-made wooden fences, which were already
moss-grown and weather-stained, rose an unfinished colossal
equestrian statue in greenish clay; <i>Il Cavallo</i>, the bold achievement
of Leonardo da Vinci, no less than twenty <i>braccia</i> in
altitude. The tremendous horse, dark against the watery sky,
was rearing; a fallen warrior was beneath his hoofs; on his
back, Francesco Sforza, the great <i>condottiere</i>, half-soldier, half
brigand, wholly adventurer, who had served with his sword and
his blood for money. The son of a peasant, strong as a lion,
astute as a fox, he attained by sagacity, by crime, and by great
exploits, the summit of power, and died on the throne of the
Dukes of Milan. Pale sunshine fell full on the colossal figure,
and in the grossness of the double chin, in the rapacity of
the fierce and vigilant eye, Giovanni saw the calm of the
gorged wild beast. Leonardo himself had inscribed the clay
with this distich:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Expectant animi molemque futuram</p>
<p>&nbsp;Suscipiunt; fluat aes; vox erit; Ecce Deus.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The last two words were astounding to Giovanni. 'Behold
the god.'</p>

<p>'A god?' he repeated, looking at the colossal clay, at the
victim trampled by the violent conqueror. He remembered
the quiet convent refectory of 'Our Lady of Grace,' the hills
of Zion, the celestial beauty of St. John, the stillness of the
Last Supper: and that God, of whom it was said, 'Behold
the Man!'</p>

<p>At this moment Leonardo himself appeared.</p>

<p>'Let us hurry,' he said; 'it seems that the kitchen chimneys
are smoking; and if we do not flee they will be calling
me back to mend them.'</p>

<p>Giovanni could not answer him; he stood downcast and
pallid.</p>

<p>'Master,' he said presently, 'I crave your pardon; but I
have thought long, and still I comprehend not how you were
able to create the <i>Cavallo</i> and the <i>Cenacolo</i> at one and the
same time.'</p>

<p>Leonardo looked at his disciple in quiet surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
'Why not?'</p>

<p>'Oh, Messer Leonardo! do you not feel yourself that they
are impossible together?'</p>

<p>'No, Giovanni. To my thinking, one helps out the other.
My best ideas for the <i>Cenacolo</i> come to me when I am working
at the Colossus; and in that convent refectory yonder,
I love to think upon this monument of Duke Francesco.
The works are twins. I began them together, and together I
shall finish them.'</p>

<p>'Together! Christ, and this man? It is impossible!'
And ignorant how to express his thought, yet feeling his heart
on fire, he repeated passionately, 'It is impossible!'</p>

<p>'And why?' asked the master with his quiet smile.</p>

<p>Giovanni would have tried to reply; but meeting those
calm uncomprehending eyes, the words died upon his lips,
for Leonardo would not have understood them. So he held
his peace and thought within himself.</p>

<p>'Strange! An hour ago, looking at his picture, I fancied
that I knew him. And now I find I do not know him at all.
Of which of those twain does he say in his heart: 'Behold
the god?''</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>That night when all others slept, Giovanni, tormented by
insomnia, rose and went into the court, where was a stone
bench under a tent of vine branches. The court was square,
and in its centre was a well; behind the bench was the wall of
the house, opposite the stable; to the left a stone wall with a
wicket-gate which opened on the street of the Porta Vercellina;
to the right the wall of a little garden and a door always
locked and leading to a separate building. Here Astro alone
was allowed ingress, and here Leonardo was wont to work
in complete seclusion.</p>

<p>The night was still and warm, with a thick mist, penetrated
by dim moonlight. A low knock sounded on the gate which
opened on the road; the shutter of one of the lower windows
was opened, and a man peered out, asking:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Monna Cassandra?'</p>

<p>''Tis I. Open!'</p>

<p>Astro came from the house and let her in; a girl clad in
white, which the moonlight and the mist changed to a strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
green. They parleyed together at the gate; then passed
Giovanni without seeing him, where he sat in the deep
shadow of the vine branches.</p>

<p>The girl seated herself on the low wall of the well. Her
face was an odd one, immobile and placid, like the faces of
old statues. She had a low forehead, straight black eyebrows,
too small a chin, and eyes of transparent amber.
But what chiefly struck Giovanni was her hair, so light, so
soft, so crisp, as if possessed of life. Like the Medusa's
aureole of serpents, its blackness framed her face, making
its paleness paler, its lips more scarlet, its amber eyes more
translucent.</p>

<p>'Then you too, Astro, have heard speak of Frate Angelo?'
said the girl.</p>

<p>'Yes, Monna Cassandra. They say the Pope hath sent
him to extirpate heresy and black magic. And I tell you,
merely to hear what is told of the Fathers Inquisitors raises
the hair of your skin! God keep us from their claws!
Monna Cassandra, be discreet; and, above all, warn your
aunt.'</p>

<p>'A pretty aunt she is to me!'</p>

<p>'It matters not. Warn that Monna Sidonia with whom
you live.'</p>

<p>'Then, blacksmith, you suppose us witches?'</p>

<p>'I suppose nothing. Messer Leonardo hath taught me
there is no witchcraft; nor can be none, by the law of nature.
Messer Leonardo knows everything and believes in nothing.'</p>

<p>'Believes in nothing? Not in the devil? Not in God?'</p>

<p>'Jest not! Messer Leonardo is a saint.'</p>

<p>'And your flying-machine?' she said contemptuously; 'is
it ready?'</p>

<p>The smith waved his hand despairingly.</p>

<p>'Ready? We are going to make it all over again!'</p>

<p>'Astro! Astro! You credit this nonsense? These
machines are dust cast into the eyes. I wager Messer
Leonardo has flown many a time ere now.'</p>

<p>'Flown? How?'</p>

<p>'He flies&mdash;as I fly.'</p>

<p>He surveyed her thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'You fly in dreams, Monna Cassandra.'</p>

<p>'You think that is it? Nay, others have seen me fly.
Perhaps you know not the tale?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
The smith scratched his head hesitatingly.</p>

<p>'But I forget,' she said mockingly; 'you are all learned
folk here, who believe not in miracles, but in mechanics.'</p>

<p>'S'death! Those same mechanics are a weight on my
neck. Did you but know&mdash;&mdash;' He spread out his hands
appealingly, and continued: 'Monna Cassandra; you know
my faithfulness. Nor is there temptation to chatter, lest Frate
Angelo play eavesdropper. Tell me, then, in all secrecy, tell
me of your charity with all the particulars&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Tell you what?'</p>

<p>'How you fly.'</p>

<p>'Not that, my friend; no. If you know too much you
will age too soon.'</p>

<p>She paused; then said softly, after a long look straight into
his eyes. 'What avails it to talk? You must act.'</p>

<p>'What is required?' asked Astro in trembling tones, and
turning pale.</p>

<p>'You must know a certain word, and you must anoint your
skin with a certain unguent.'</p>

<p>'Have you this unguent?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'And you know the word?'</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>'And then one can fly?'</p>

<p>'Try. You will find my method simpler than your
mechanics.'</p>

<p>The single eye of the smith blazed with the madness of
desire.</p>

<p>'Monna Cassandra, give me your unguent.'</p>

<p>She suppressed a laugh.</p>

<p>'You are a simpleton, Astro. Five minutes ago you called
magic foolery; now, it seems, you believe in it.'</p>

<p>Astro hung his head, convicted, but unrepentant.</p>

<p>'I wish to fly. I care little if I attain by mechanics or by
miracles. What I can endure no longer is waiting.'</p>

<p>The girl laid her hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>'I see, I see. Truly, I pity you. It is clear your brain
will crack if you don't get to your flying. Good, then; I will
give you the drug and I will teach you the word. But you
likewise, Astro, you must do what I ask of you.'</p>

<p>'I will, Monna Cassandra. I will do anything. Speak.'
The girl pointed to the wet roof beyond the garden wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
'Let me enter there.'</p>

<p>But Astro frowned and shook his head.</p>

<p>'Nay. I will do whatever you ask, saving only that.'</p>

<p>'And why not that?'</p>

<p>'I have promised my master to let none in.'</p>

<p>'But you go thither?'</p>

<p>'Yea.'</p>

<p>'What is there within?'</p>

<p>'No mystery, Monna Cassandra; nothing of moment.
Machines, appliances, books, manuscripts. Certain strange
plants, beasts, creeping things. Travellers bring them from
distant lands. And there is one tree which has been poisoned.'</p>

<p>'What? poisoned?'</p>

<p>'Ay. He has it for experiments; that he may know the
effect poison has upon plants.'</p>

<p>'Good Astro, tell me all you know of that tree.'</p>

<p>'There is naught to tell. Early in the spring season he
bored him a hole in its trunk, to the very core; and with a
long thin needle he squirted in some venom.'</p>

<p>'What strange experiments! And of what sort is the
tree?'</p>

<p>'A peach-tree.'</p>

<p>'What followed? Was the fruit also poisoned?'</p>

<p>'It will be so when ripe.'</p>

<p>'Can you see in the peaches that they are poisoned?'</p>

<p>'No; and that is why he permits no entry, lest some one
might eat the fruit and die.'</p>

<p>'Have you the key?'</p>

<p>'Ay.'</p>

<p>'Good Astro, give it to me!'</p>

<p>'Monna Cassandra! Have I not sworn to him?'</p>

<p>'Give me the key; and I will compass it that to-night you
shall fly&mdash;this very night. See, this is the drug.'</p>

<p>She drew from her bosom a phial which contained a dark
liquid; and putting her face close to his, she whispered
wheedlingly, 'What is it you fear, simpleton? You say there
are no mysteries. Well, then, let us go and make sure. The
key, Astro, the key!'</p>

<p>'No,' he replied, 'I will not let you enter; and I care
nothing for your secret. Leave me.'</p>

<p>'Coward!' cried the girl, fine scorn on her face; 'it is
possible for you to know the secret, and you dare not hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
it! Now I see plainly he is a sorcerer, and he tricks you as
he would trick an infant!'</p>

<p>But neither could scorn move him; he turned away his
head, listening sullenly. Then Cassandra drew nearer again.</p>

<p>'Well, Astro, so be it. I will not enter. Only do you set
the door ajar and let me peep&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You will not go in?'</p>

<p>'No; only open and let me just look.'</p>

<p>At this he drew forth the key and unlocked the door.</p>

<p>Giovanni, rising softly and drawing nearer, saw a common
peach-tree at the far end of the little walled garden; under
the dim green moonlight the tree seemed weird and ill-omened.</p>

<p>Standing in the doorway, the girl looked about her with the
wide eyes of eager curiosity. Then she took a step forward.
The smith held her back; but she freed herself and slipped
through his hands like a snake. He again pushed her out,
almost overthrowing her. But she recovered her balance
easily, and looked him full in the eyes. Her face pale,
livid, and contracted with rage, was terrifying; at that
moment she truly seemed a witch.</p>

<p>The smith clapped to the door, and without further speech
retreated to the house, she following him with her golden
eyes. Presently she strode hastily past Giovanni, and through
the wicket into the road of the Porta Vercellina. Once more
silence reigned, and the mist thickened; all things vanished
in it.</p>

<p>Giovanni, left alone, closed his eyes painfully. Before him
rose as in a vision the awful tree, the heavy drops on its
damp leaves, its poisoned fruits, pallidly illuminated. And
he thought of the words:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat. But
of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt
not eat. For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
surely die.'</p>

<p>Beatrice, the duchess, used every Friday to bathe her
hair, and then tincture it with gold, after which she dried
it in the sunshine. For her convenience she had caused
balustraded '<i>altane</i>,' or platforms, to be erected on the roof
of the splendid ducal villa of the Sforzesca, which stood on
the right bank of the Ticino, near the fortress of Vigevano,
among the fat pastures and the ever green water-side meadows
of the province of Lomellina. Here, then, she sat, patiently
supporting the blazing heat at an hour when even husbandmen
and their oxen were wont to creep into the shadow.
She wore a <i>schiavinetta</i>&mdash;a loose white silk wrapper without
sleeves. On her head was a kind of straw sunshade, or hat,
from the opening in the top of which flowed out the broad
masses of her gilded and rippling hair. An olive-skinned
Circassian slave was moistening the hair with a sponge, fixed
on the point of a spindle; and a Tartar, slit-eyed and crooked,
was combing it with an ivory comb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
The dye was made in May of the roots of walnut trees,
saffron, ox-gall, swallows' lime, ambergris, bears' claws, and
the fat of lizards. Close beside the duchess, and watched
by herself, an infusion of musk roses and precious spices was
simmering in a long-necked retort, upon a tripod over an
invisible flame.</p>

<p>Both the waiting-maids were bathed in perspiration; even
the duchess's lapdog was ill at ease on this burning <i>altana</i>,
and, panting and lolling out his tongue, gazed reproachfully at
his mistress, nor responded as usual to the provocation of the
monkey. The latter was luxuriating in the heat, however,
like the negro page, who held the gemmed and jewelled
mother-o'-pearl mirror.</p>

<p>Though the Lady Beatrice constantly endeavoured to
compose countenance and deportment to the severity becoming
her rank, it was hard to believe that she was nineteen,
had been married three years, and had borne two
children. In the girlish roundness of her dark cheek, in
the childish dimple, the slender throat, the chin too plump;
in the full lips tightly compressed as if always tempted to
pout; in the slight shoulders and flat bosom; in the abrupt
boyish movements, she appeared still a schoolgirl, spoiled,
wilful, restless and even selfish. Yet prudence and intelligence
shone from the steady, dark eyes; and the Venetian
ambassador, Marino Sanuto, most astute of statesmen, had
written in his private letters to his government that this girl
was hard as flint, and gave him far more trouble than did
her husband, Il Moro; who indeed showed his wisdom by
obeying her about everything.</p>

<p>The dog barked angrily, and up the winding stair which
led to the <i>altana</i> came laboriously an old woman habited
like a widow. In one hand she held a crutch, in the other
a rosary; the wrinkles in her face might have given her a
reverend aspect, had not the withered mouth smiled hypocritically,
and the eyes sparkled with audacious cunning.</p>

<p>'Ugh, ugh! How detestable is old age! I could hardly
drag myself hither. May the Lord preserve youth and health
to your Excellency,' said the old woman, kissing the hem of
the <i>schiavinetta</i>.</p>

<p>'Well, Monna Sidonia, is it ready?'</p>

<p>The crone drew from her pouch a carefully wrapped,
closely-stoppered phial, containing a turbid, whitish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
liquid,&mdash;the milk of a red goat and of an ass, distilled with wild
anise, asparagus, and white lilies.</p>

<p>'In good sooth, her Excellency should keep it two little
days more in good horse litter. Yet it can be used at once if
needful; only first strain it through a filter. Wet with it
crumbs of stale bread, and then be pleased to rub your
noble countenance for such a period as would take the
reciting of three <i>credos</i>. In five weeks' time all swarthiness
will be removed, and pimples beside.'</p>

<p>'Hearken, old woman,' said Beatrice; 'in this lotion there
are again, mayhap, some of the abominable things used in
black magic,&mdash;snakes' fat, perchance, or plovers' blood; or
powdered lizards, fried in a frying-pan; such as there were
in that unguent you gave me for withering the hair in my
cheek-moles. If it be so, tell me at once.'</p>

<p>'Your Excellency should not lend her ear to the calumnies
of the malignant. I work honestly, as my conscience dictates;
but no one can do without dirt sometimes. The
magnificent Madonna Angelica, for example, all last year
washed her head with dogs' urine, so as to preserve her
hair, which was falling out; and thanked God and me it
cured her.' Then, bending down to the duchess's ear, she
told the latest gossip:&mdash;how the young wife of the Master of
the Guild of the Salters, the lovely Madonna Filiberta was
deceiving her husband with a Spanish cavalier, and diverting
herself hugely.</p>

<p>'And doubtless,' said Beatrice, jestingly threatening with
her finger, ''twas you who brought the poor thing to it, you
old bawd!'</p>

<p>'Does your Excellency call her <i>poor</i>? Nay, she sings me
her thanks every hour. Now she knows the difference
between the kiss of a spouse and the kiss of a lover.'</p>

<p>'But the sin? Doth not her conscience bite her?'</p>

<p>'Her conscience? Madam, I hold the sin of love the
work of nature. And a few drops of holy water can wash the
sin away. Madonna Filiberta is but giving her spouse a
Roland for his Oliver.'</p>

<p>'Is your meaning that likewise the husband&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Say it for certain, I do not&mdash;but sure it is that all married
men harp on one string. There is none of them but would
sooner have a single hand than a single wife.'</p>

<p>The duchess laughed. 'Ah, Monna Sidonia, Monna
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Sidonia, there's no tripping you! But where do you learn
all these things?'</p>

<p>'Believe the word of an old woman; what I tell you is
gospel truth. And in matters of conscience I know the
difference between a beam and a mote. All fruit gets ripe
in its season. If she have not her fill of love when she be
young, a woman will fall into such longing when she is old,
that she will go straight into the claws of the devil.'</p>

<p>'You preach like a doctor of theology.'</p>

<p>'Nay, I am unlearned; but I speak from my heart, and I
tell your Excellency that youth comes but once in life; for
what the devil&mdash;Lord forgive me!&mdash;is the use of us women
when we are old? Perhaps to throw charcoal on the brazier,
and to count the pots and the pans in the kitchen. Not
for nothing says the proverb.</p>

<p>"La giovane mangia, la vecchia s'ingozza."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Beauty without love is like matins without a paternoster.'</p>

<p>'What! say that over again!' laughed the duchess.</p>

<p>The old woman, thinking she had now trifled enough, again
bent to the lady's ear and whispered. Beatrice ceased to
laugh, her face darkened. She dismissed her attendants,
excepting the little blackamoor who had no Italian. Around
them was only the still and glowing air, which seemed to have
paled under the fury of the heat.</p>

<p>'Folly!' answered the duchess; 'such chattering is of no
moment.'</p>

<p>'Signora, I saw with my eyes, I heard with my ears. Others
will tell you the like.'</p>

<p>'Were there many persons?'</p>

<p>'Ten thousand. The piazza before the Castle of Pavia
was thronged.'</p>

<p>'What heard you?'</p>

<p>'When Madonna Isabella came forth bearing the little
Francesco there was a beating of hands, a waving of caps,
and a many who shed tears. "<i>Viva</i> Isabella of Aragon,"
they cried, "<i>Viva</i> Gian Galeazzo and his heir, our true and
legitimate lord! Death to the usurpers of his throne!"'</p>

<p>Beatrice frowned. 'Those were the very words?'</p>

<p>'Ay; but there was worse.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
'Speak&mdash;fear nothing.'</p>

<p>'They cried&mdash;my tongue, <i>Signora mia</i>, refuses&mdash;but they
cried "Death to the Robbers!"'</p>

<p>Beatrice shivered; mastering herself, however, she asked
calmly, 'Was there more?'</p>

<p>'Of a truth, I know not how to tell it to your Excellency.'</p>

<p>'Haste thee, I would know all.'</p>

<p>'Believe me, madam, they said that the most noble duke,
Ludovico il Moro, the guardian and the benefactor of Gian
Galeazzo, holds his nephew in the fortress of Pavia, and
surrounds him with assassins and spies. Then they demanded
that the duke himself should come out to them, but Madonna
Isabella answered that he lay sick.'</p>

<p>And again Monna Sidonia whispered in the duchess's ear.</p>

<p>'But you are distraught, you old hag,' cried the lady.
'Beware, lest I have you thrown from this roof, so that not
even a crow can get your bones together.'</p>

<p>The threat did not frighten Monna Sidonia. Beatrice also
soon calmed.</p>

<p>'I don't believe a word of it,' she said, observing the crone
furtively.</p>

<p>'As you please, Excellency,' answered the other, shrugging
lean shoulders, 'but nothing can prevent my words from
being true. See you,' she continued insinuatingly, 'you make
a small figure of wax, and you put a swallow's heart in at the
right side, at the left its liver, then you pierce it with a needle,
uttering charms the while; and he will die of a slow death,
nor is there doctor who can save him.'</p>

<p>'Silence!' commanded the duchess.</p>

<p>The hag again devoutly kissed the hem of the <i>schiavinetta</i>.
'Your Grace is my sun. I love you overmuch, 'tis my worst
fault.' She paused, then added, 'It can be done also without
witchcraft.'</p>

<p>The duchess was silent, but she looked at the woman
curiously.</p>

<p>'As I came by the palace garden,' resumed Monna Sidonia,
dryly, 'I saw the gardener collecting fair ripe peaches in a
basket, a present doubtless for Messer Gian Galeazzo.' Another
pause, and she continued, 'And likewise in the garden of
Messer Leonardo da Vinci, the Florentine, there are fair ripe
peaches, but empoisoned.'</p>

<p>'Empoisoned?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
'Ay, Monna Cassandra, my niece, saw&mdash;&mdash;' And again she
whispered.</p>

<p>The duchess made no answer. By this time her hair was
dry, and she rose, threw off the <i>schiavinetta</i>, and descended to
the apartment known as the wardrobe. Here were three huge
presses; the first, large as that in some great sacristy, contained
the eighty-four dresses which she had found time to acquire
in the three years of her married life; some so stiff with
gold and jewels that they could stand on the floor by themselves,
others diaphanous, imponderous as the web of a
spider. In the second press were riding-dresses, and all
furniture for hawking. In the third, essences, waters, washes,
unguents, powders for the teeth of white coral and
seed-pearls, innumerable vases, retorts, rectified alembics,
crucibles, in short, a complete laboratory of female alchemy;
precious cedar-wood chests, also, covered with paintings
and embroidery. From one of these the waiting-woman
drew forth a chemise of the purest whiteness. The room
filled with a scent of lavender, oriental iris, and dried
Damascus roses.</p>

<p>While she dressed, Beatrice conversed about the trimming
of a new gown just received by courier from her sister,
Isabella d'Este, the Marchioness of Mantua. The sisters
vied with each other in elegance, and Beatrice paid a court
spy to keep her informed of all the novelties in the Mantuan
wardrobe.</p>

<p>The duchess attired herself in her favourite robe, which,
striped with gold satin and green velvet, made her seem
taller than she was. The open-work sleeves were tied with
bands of grey silk, slashed in the French mode, and showing
the white puffings of the undergarment. Her hair was plaited
and confined in a gold net and fine gold cord, which was
clasped by a scorpion of rubies.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>II</h3>

<p>She was in the habit of spending so long a time at the
morning toilette that the duke said he could as quickly have
fitted a merchant ship for the Indies. On this occasion,
however, hearing a distant sound of horns and the baying of
hounds, she remembered that she had ordered a hunt,
and consequently hurried. When dressed she paid a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
passing visit to the chamber of her dwarfs, which, in
imitation of the royal play-room of Isabella d'Este, she
nicknamed 'the Apartment of the Giants.' Here everything
was arranged for a population of pygmies: chairs, beds,
furniture, ladders, even a chapel with a toy altar at which
daily service was read by a learned dwarf named Janachi in
archiepiscopal robes and mitre. Among the 'giants' was
always much noise: laughter and weeping, the cries of various
and eerie voices from hunchbacks, apes, parrots, idiots,
Tartars, buffoons, and other absurd creatures, with whom
the youthful duchess sometimes passed whole days playing.
To-day she looked in merely to inquire after the health
of a little negro named Nannino, lately sent from Venice.
His skin had been so black, that in the words of his former
mistress, 'Nothing more exquisite could be desired,' but
now that he had fallen ill it had become apparent that
his hue was not entirely natural, for a coating, black and
shining like lacquer, was peeling off and causing great
chagrin to Beatrice. However, she loved him in spite of
his growing fairness, and hearing with distress that he was
likely to die, she gave orders to have him christened as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Descending the staircase, she met Morgantina, her favourite
female fool, who was young, pretty, and so whimsical
that she 'could rouse even the dead to laughter.' She stole
and hid booty like a magpie, but if spoken to kindly
would confess her crimes, and was simple and innocent as a
child. Sometimes, however, she fell into fits of melancholy,
wailing for her lost son (who had never existed). This morning
she was sitting on the stair hugging her knees and sobbing
distractedly. Beatrice patted her on the head.</p>

<p>'Cease, little one, cease,' she said, 'be good.'</p>

<p>The fool, raising her childish blue eyes streaming with
tears, made reply, 'Oh! oh! oh! they have taken my baby
away! And, O Lord, why? What harm had he done?'</p>

<p>Without another word the duchess went down into the
courtyard where the huntsmen were awaiting her.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Surrounded by outriders, falconers, beaters, equerries,
pages, and court-ladies, Beatrice sat her slender dark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
bay Arab&mdash;a superb creature from Gonzaga's stables&mdash;like
an expert horseman. 'A true queen of Amazons,'
thought her husband proudly, as he came out of the pleached
alley before the palace to watch his consort's start.</p>

<p>Behind the duchess rode a falconer in a sumptuous livery,
embroidered with gold. A snow-white Cyprus falcon, a gift
from the Sultan, its golden hood glittering with emeralds,
and little bells attached to its claws, sat on his left hand.</p>

<p>Beatrice was in lively humour; she looked at her husband
with a smile, but when he said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Be wary! the horse is mettlesome,' she signed to her
companions and darted off at a gallop, first along the road,
then over the open fields, across ditches, hillocks, and
trenches. Her retinue fell behind; but Beatrice was attended
by a huge wolf-hound, and by her side, on a black Castilian
mare, the gayest and boldest of her maidens, rode Madonna
Lucrezia Crivelli. The duke was by no means indifferent
to this lady, and as he watched her and Beatrice side by side
in this mad gallop, it would have perplexed him to say which
of the two he admired the more. However, he certainly
experienced an invincible anxiety for his young wife, and when
she leaped a deep chasm, he closed his eyes and caught his
breath. Often he had reproved her for these follies, but
had not the heart to forbid them; deficient himself in physical
courage, he was proud of the daring of his lady.</p>

<p>The party descended into the ravine and disappeared
among the osier thickets of the low banks of the Ticino, the
breeding place of ducks, woodcock, and herons.</p>

<p>Then the duke returned to his <i>studiolo</i>, where Messer
Bartolomeo Calco, his chief secretary, who had charge of
the embassies from the foreign courts, was awaiting
commands.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Sitting in his high-backed armchair, Ludovico Sforza softly
stroked his smooth-shaved chin with a white and well-kept
hand. His handsome face wore that expression of perfect
candour which is acquired by past masters in political
trickery; his high-bridged aquiline nose, and subtly writhen
lips recalled his father Francesco, the great <i>Condottiere</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
though if Francesco were, as the poets said, at once lion
and fox, Ludovico was merely fox. He was attired in pale
blue silk, puffed and embroidered; his smooth hair covered
ears and brow like a wig, and a gold chain dangled on his
breast; in word and gesture he was uniformly courteous and
urbane.</p>

<p>'Have you certain intelligence, Messer Bartolomeo, of the
departure of the French army from Lyons?'</p>

<p>'None, your Excellency. Every evening they say "to-morrow,"
every morning they say "to-night." The king
wastes himself in unwarlike amusements.'</p>

<p>'Who is his first favourite?'</p>

<p>'Many names are mentioned, the taste of his Majesty is
variable.'</p>

<p>'Write to Count Belgioioso that I send him thirty&mdash;no&mdash;forty
or fifty thousand ducats to spend in new donatives, let
him spare nothing. We must draw this king out of Lyons
by golden chains. And, Bartolomeo&mdash;but repeat this not&mdash;it
were well to send his Majesty the portraits of some of our
fairest ladies. By the way, is the letter ready?'</p>

<p>'It is, Signore.'</p>

<p>'Show it to me.'</p>

<p>Il Moro rubbed his white hands for pleasure. Every time
he contemplated his huge web of policy, he felt an agreeable
stirring at heart; he loved the dangerous game. Nor did he
blame himself for having summoned the foreigners, the
northern barbarians, into Italy; his enemies had forced him
to this extreme measure, chiefly the consort of Gian
Galeazzo, Isabella of Aragon, who openly accused him of
having usurped the throne of his nephew. Yet it had not
been till her father, Alfonso of Naples, had intervened,
threatening war and dethronement, that Ludovico had
appealed to Charles <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span> King of France.</p>

<p>'Inscrutable are thy ways, O Lord!' thought the duke
piously, while his secretary searched for the letter in a pile
of papers; 'the salvation of my kingdom, of Italy, perhaps
of all Europe, is in the hands of this abortion of nature,
this libertine, this witless boy, whom they name the Most
Christian King of France; before whom we, the heirs of the
glory of the Sforzas, must crouch, and creep, and play the
pander. But such are politics; he who hunts with wolves
must howl with them.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
He read over the letter, which seemed to him sufficiently
well expressed.</p>

<p>'May the Lord bless thy crusading army, O most Christian,'
so it ran; 'the gates of Ausonia stand open to thee. Hesitate
not to enter in triumph, a new Hannibal! The peoples of
Italy yearn to bow beneath thy gentle yoke, O anointed of
the Most High....'</p>

<p>So far the duke had read when a humpbacked, bald, old
man looked in at the door. Ludovico smiled, but motioned
to him to wait. The head vanished, and the door closed again
softly; but the secretary saw he had lost his master's attention.
Messer Bartolomeo therefore concluded the letter and
went out. The duke cautiously stepped to the door on the
tips of his toes, and called softly&mdash;</p>

<p>'Bernardo! Hist! Bernardo!'</p>

<p>'Here, my lord.' And the court poet, Bernardo Bellincioni,
advanced with an air of mystery and servility, and he would
have fallen on his knees to kiss the duke's hand: the latter,
however, restrained him.</p>

<p>'Well? Well?'</p>

<p>'All is right, my lord.'</p>

<p>'Is she brought to bed?'</p>

<p>'Last night saw her released from her burden.'</p>

<p>'Felicitously? Or shall I send my physician?'</p>

<p>'Nay, the mother is doing perfectly.'</p>

<p>'Glory be to God! And the child?'</p>

<p>'Perfect.'</p>

<p>'Male or female?'</p>

<p>'A man-child. And with a voice&mdash;! Fair hair as his
mother's; but the eyes black, burning and quick like those
of your Grace. The princely blood shows itself. A little
Hercules! Madonna Cecilia is beside herself with joy;
and bade me inquire the name that will please your
Excellency.'</p>

<p>'I have considered that. We will call him Caesar. What
think you of that?'</p>

<p>''Tis a fine name; well mouthing, and ancient. Cesare
Sforza! A name meant for a hero.'</p>

<p>'Well now&mdash;about the husband?'</p>

<p>'The illustrious Count Bergamini is good and courteous
as ever.'</p>

<p>'Admirable man!' cried the duke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
'Your Excellency will permit me to pronounce him a man
of rare virtue. Such men are to seek nowadays. If the
gout permit, he would desire to sup with your Worship, to
testify to his respect.'</p>

<p>The Countess Cecilia of whom they spoke had long been
Ludovico's mistress. But Beatrice, his bride, daughter of
Ercole d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, having discovered the amour,
became furiously jealous; and by threats of return to her
paternal home, she induced her lord not only to swear better
observance of his conjugal fidelity, but also to bestow Cecilia
in wedlock. The husband selected by Ludovico was the
ancient and complaisant Count Bergamini.</p>

<p>Bellincioni, taking a small paper from his pocket, presented
it to the duke. It was a sonnet in honour of the
newly born:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Thou weepest, Ph&oelig;bus! Why this silver rain?</p>
<p>Because this day upon the amazèd skies,</p>
<p>Lo! I have seen a second sun arise,</p>
<p>Before whose splendours all my glories wane.'</p>
<p>'This is a tale for laughter!' 'Nay, for pain,</p>
<p>Truth suffers no derision from the wise.'</p>
<p>'Then tell me more, and still my loud surprise,</p>
<p>That queries whence this newer king shall reign.'</p>
<p>'The offspring of a Moor, he makes his nest</p>
<p>In sweet Cecilia's arms&mdash;I saw his light</p>
<p>Shine through the brooding feathers of her love;</p>
<p>Now, must I hide me in the cloudy west,</p>
<p>Eclipsed by one more radiant and more bright,</p>
<p>Who shall greater God than Ph&oelig;bus prove.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The duke bestowed a silver piece upon the poet.</p>

<p>'Bernardo, let it not slip your memory that Saturday is
the birthday of the duchess.'</p>

<p>Bellincioni hastily fumbled in the folds of his courtly but
threadbare raiment, and from some recess therein drew forth
a whole sheaf of tumbled papers; and among grandiloquent
odes on the death of Madonna Angelina's falcon, and the
disorder of Signor Paravicino's dappled Hungarian mare,
found the verses required.</p>

<p>'Here be three for my lord to choose from,' he said. 'I
vow by the sacred footprints of Pegasus, you will be
content.'</p>

<p>In those times sovereigns used their court poets as musical
instruments, to serenade not their mistresses only, but also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
their wives; fashion demanded that between husband and
wife at least platonic love should be assumed.</p>

<p>The duke ran through the verses curiously; though he
could not himself string two lines together. In the first
sonnet he found two lines to his taste, where the husband
turns to his wife with these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Where thy light spittle falls, flowers gem the earth</p>
<p>&nbsp;As dews of spring bring violets to birth.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the second the poet, comparing Madonna Beatrice with
the goddess Diana, asserted that boars and stags felt happiness
in falling by the hand of so fair a huntress. The
third poem pleased Il Moro better than all the rest. It was
put into the mouth of Dante, who prays that God may permit
him to return to earth, since there he would once more
find his Beatrice in the person of the Duchess of Milan.</p>

<p>'O great Jove!' cried Alighieri, 'since thou hast again
given her to the earth that she may gladden it with the light
of love, permit me also to be with her, and to see him
whose felicity she is, and whose life she maketh most
proud and glad.'</p>

<p>Il Moro graciously slapped the poet on his back, and promised
him some scarlet Florentine cloth at ten <i>soldi</i> the
<i>braccio</i> for his winter cloak. Bernardo, by no means satisfied,
made many bowings and bendings, and obtained at last the
promise of some fox skin linings. He explained that his
furs had become by long wear as hairless and transparent
as vermicelli drying in the sun.</p>

<p>'Last winter,' he continued, 'I was so cold that I was
ready to burn not only my own staircase but the wooden
shoes of St. Francis.'</p>

<p>The duke laughed, and promised him firewood, and
Bellincioni instantly improvised a laudatory quatrain.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'When to thy servants thou dost promise bread</p>
<p>&nbsp;Like God thou giv'st them heavenly manna,</p>
<p>&nbsp;For which great Ph&oelig;bus and the choir of nine</p>
<p>&nbsp;Chant, noble Moor, to thee Hosanna.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>'You seem in the vein to-day, Bernardo. Hearken, I
require yet another poem.'</p>

<p>'Erotic?'</p>

<p>'Ay; and impassioned.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
'For the duchess?'</p>

<p>'By no means. But, beware you speak not of this!'</p>

<p>'My lord is pleased to insult me. Have I ever&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Not yet.'</p>

<p>'I am dumb as any fish,' and he blinked his eyes obsequiously
and mysteriously. 'Impassioned? That I understand.
But of what kind? Grateful? Imploring?'</p>

<p>'The last.'</p>

<p>The poet drew his brows together with an air of grave
solicitude.</p>

<p>'Wedded?'</p>

<p>'A maid.'</p>

<p>'Good. But I shall need the name.'</p>

<p>'What on earth matters the name?'</p>

<p>'Can't do imploring without the name.'</p>

<p>'Madonna Lucrezia.&mdash;You have nothing ready?'</p>

<p>'Truly, my lord, I have; but something fresh would please
better. Permit me the seclusion of the next apartment;
'twill be the affair of a moment. Already I feel the rhymes
crawling in my head.'</p>

<p>Just then a page announced 'Messer Leonardo da Vinci,'
and Bellincioni disappeared through one door as Leonardo
entered at the other.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>V</h3>

<p>After the opening salutations the duke and the artist
fell to discussing the new canal which was to connect
the Sesia and the Ticino, and by a branching network of
trenches was to irrigate the meadows and pastures of the
Lomellina. Leonardo was superintendent of the excavations
for the canal, though he had not the title of Ducal
Architect; neither was he called the Court Painter, but only
the <i>Sonatore di lire</i>, a title which gave him precedence of
the court poets like Bellincioni, and had been accorded to
him because on arrival in Milan he had presented Sforza
with a silver lyre, made by his own hand in the shape of
a horse's head.</p>

<p>Having explained his design for the canal, Leonardo
requested of the duke that he might be put in possession of
the further moneys necessary for the prosecution of the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
'How much?' asked Ludovico.</p>

<p>'Five hundred and six ducats for every league: in all,
fifteen thousand one hundred and eighty-seven.'</p>

<p>Ludovico frowned, remembering the fifty thousand he had
just devoted to the corruption of French nobles.</p>

<p>'Too much, too much, Messer Leonardo. You would
ruin me. It is impossible, unexampled. Why these boundless
designs? I might consult Bramante, you know, who is
also an expert in construction. He works more cheaply.'</p>

<p>Leonardo shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>'As you please, my lord. Entrust it to Bramante.'</p>

<p>'Nay, be not offended. I have no thought of slighting you.'
And they fell to bargaining.</p>

<p>'<i>Va bene, va bene!</i>' said the duke at last, deferring the
conclusion of the agreement; and he took up Leonardo's
sketch-book and turned over the unfinished drawings, chiefly
architectural and mechanical: the artist, somewhat impatient,
had to furnish explanations and commentaries.</p>

<p>On one sheet there was a huge mausoleum, an artificial
mountain crowned with a colonnaded temple, its dome
pierced like that of the Pantheon; on the next, the exact
calculations and the ground-plan for the edifice, with details
for the disposition of stairs, cells, corridors; the whole being
destined for the reception of five hundred sepulchral urns.</p>

<p>'What is this?' asked the duke; 'when and for whom have
you designed it?'</p>

<p>'For no one. 'Tis a fantasy.'</p>

<p>'Strange fantasy!' commented Ludovico shaking his head;
''tis a cemetery for the gods or the Titans, like a building in
a city of dreams.'</p>

<p>The next sketch showed the plan for a town with the streets
in tiers, one above the other, the upper for the rich, the lower
for the poor, for animals, and for refuse; a town to be built
in conformity with natural laws; for men without a conscience
to be offended by glaring inequality.</p>

<p>'Not so bad!' observed the duke. 'You think it would
be practicable?'</p>

<p>'Certainly,' said Leonardo brightening, 'I have long wished
your Excellency could be induced to try it, say in one of the
suburbs. Five thousand houses would suffice for thirty
thousand people; they would be decently divided, whereas
now they herd together in dirt and distemper, disseminating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
the seeds of disease. My plan, Signore, if literally carried
out, would provide the finest city in the world.'</p>

<p>The duke's laughter checked the enthusiast.</p>

<p>'You are finely crazed, Messer Leonardo. If I gave you
the reins you would turn the State topsy-turvy. You do not
see that the most submissive of slaves would resent your two-storeyed
streets, would spit upon your boasted cleanliness&mdash;your
pipes and conduits&mdash;your finest city in the world, <i>perdio</i>;
and would flee back to their lousy old towns again, where, as
you say, they have a good modicum of filth and distemper,
but no insults to their self-respect. Well, and this?' he
added, pointing to another drawing.</p>

<p>This proved to be a design for a 'house of accommodation,'
with secret rooms, doors, and passages, so disposed that the
visitors should not meet each other.</p>

<p>'Ah! this is admirable!' cried the duke. 'I am weary
of the robbings and the murderings in these places. Here
there would be order and security. I will build at once on
your plan.' He smiled and added, 'Bravo! Bravo! I see
nothing is beneath your ingenuity. <i>A proposito!</i> I remember
once reading of the "Ear of Dionysius," a construction at
Syracuse, which permitted the tyrant in his palace to hear the
speech of his prisoners in the quarry. Think you it were
possible to construct an Ear in my palace?'</p>

<p>As he spoke the duke had stammered and blushed a little,
but he recovered himself immediately: before such a man as
this artist no shame was required. And Leonardo, without
trenching on morals, eagerly discussed the acoustics of the
notion.</p>

<p>Then Bellincioni reappeared, announcing that his sonnet
was ready and passing beautiful; at which Leonardo took
flight, having accepted the duke's invitation to supper.</p>

<p>Ludovico requested the poet to read his work. The
salamander, so the sonnet ran, lives in the fire, but a lady,
of virgin ice, has her dwelling in the lover's fiery heart.
The concluding quatrain seemed to the duke surprisingly
tender:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'I sing, poor swan, of my consumèd years,</p>
<p>&nbsp;But singing brings my torture no relief;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Love with his laughter blows the flame of grief,</p>
<p>&nbsp;And mocking cries, "Extinguish it with tears."'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>While waiting till his consort should have returned from
the chase, the duke took a walk through his domain. He
inspected the stables, built like a Greek temple, with
columns, porticos, and doubly-lighted windows; the splendid
dairy, where he tasted junkets and new-made cheese;
then, passing numberless hay-barns and sheds, came to the
farm and the cattle-yards. Here every detail rejoiced his
heart; the sound of the milk falling from the udders of his
favourite Languedoc cow; the newly-littered sow's motherly
gruntings; the smell of honey from the swarming hives. A
smile of satisfaction illumined his dark face; truly his home
was like a filled goblet! He returned to the house and
waited under the gallery. It was towards evening, but not yet
the hour of sunset; from the water-meadows of the Ticino
came the pungent freshness of the grass. The duke cast his
eyes slowly over his estate; pastures, meadows, fields watered
by a network of ditches, planted with long rows of apple, and
pear, and mulberry trees, trellised with the hanging garlands
of the vines. From Mortara to Abbiategrasso and further
to the very horizon, where in the creeping twilight the snows
of Monte Rosa gleamed with unearthly radiance, the boundless
plain of Lombardy flowered like the Paradise of God.</p>

<p>'I thank thee, Lord,' said the devout duke raising his eyes
heavenward. 'I thank Thee for all. What more is there that
I could desire of Thee? Once a barren and leafless wilderness
stretched on every side, but I and Leonardo have made
these canals, watered this land, and now every blade of grass,
every ear of corn blesses me as I bless thee, O Lord!'</p>

<p>Then was heard the tongue of the hounds, and the cry of
the huntsmen, and above the vines was seen a red lure, a
formless object with partridge wings, for bringing back the
falcons. Ludovico and his <i>major domo</i> went the round of
the tables to be sure that all was ready for the evening feast.
Presently the duchess made her entry, and then the guests
trooped in, among them Leonardo. A grace was recited,
and they sat down to table.</p>

<p>The first course consisted of artichokes sent by express
from Genoa, fat eels and carp from the Mantua ponds, gift
from Isabella d'Este, and a jelly of the breasts of good
capons. The company ate with their fingers and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
knives, forks being reserved for state occasions. Certain
tiny golden ones with crystal prongs were, however, accorded
to the ladies at the fruit course. The munificent host
assiduously pressed his guests to eat; and as none ever
blushed to be hungry, the food and the liquors circulated
freely and long.</p>

<p>Lucrezia had her seat beside the duchess, and the admiring
eyes of the duke rested on them both. It pleased him that
his wife should honour the maiden of his fancy, passing
dainties from her own plate to the girl's, and caressing her
hand with that expansive and playful tenderness which young
women sometimes exhibit towards one another.</p>

<p>The conversation centred in the hunt, and Beatrice told
how the sudden burst of a stag from the thicket had almost
thrown her from her horse. Much laughter followed when
the fool Gioda, the boaster, told of the boar he had
slain, singly, and with superhuman boldness and dexterity.
The animal was a tame pig, cast in his path designedly, and
the carcase was brought in and exhibited. The fool displayed
excesses of rage at these aspersions; but his fury
and simplicity were equally assumed. He knew a bad jest
from a good one.</p>

<p>By degrees the laughter grew louder, and abundant potations
reddened all faces; the ladies surreptitiously loosened
their stay-laces. The cellarers brought round light Cyprus
wine, both red and white, mulled at the fire, and spiced with
pistachios, cinnamon, and cloves. When the duke called for
wine, his command was passed out from one to the other of
the stewards in a solemn chant, as of a church function; a
goblet was brought from the buffet, and the chief Seneschal
dipped a talisman&mdash;an unicorn on a gold chain&mdash;into the
liquor. If it were poisoned the horn of this animal was to
turn black and to shed drops of gore. Similar talismans, of
toad's-stone and serpent's-tongue, were put in the salt-cellars.
Count Bergamini, Cecilia's husband, had been given the
seat of honour, and was especially gay to-night, in spite of
age and gout. Pointing to the unicorn, he cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I fancy not the King of France has such a horn as your
most illustrious Excellency!'</p>

<p>'Hee! hee! hee!' crowed Janachi the hunchback, shaking
his rattle and clanging the bells of his motley cap, surmounted
by ass's ears. 'Believe him, nuncle, believe him!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
And the duke good-humouredly threatened the jester with
his finger. Now silver trumpets blared to announce the
entry of the roasts&mdash;boar's head and peacocks. Last came
a pasty in the figure of a castle; from its walls sounded a
trumpet, and when the crust was cut a dwarf in parrot's
plumage sprang out and hopped round the table, till captured
and imprisoned in a gilded cage. Thence he screamed out
a paternoster.</p>

<p>'Messer,' said the duchess to her lord, 'to what joyful
event must we attribute the unexpected good fare of this
feast?'</p>

<p>Il Moro made no answer, but exchanged sly glances with
Count Bergamini. Cecilia's husband understood that the
celebration was for the new-born Cesare.</p>

<p>They sat over the boar's head for more than an hour,
making no economy of time, and remembering the proverb,
'At table none groweth old.' At the close of the repast,
Fra Talpone caused general hilarity. He was a monk of
great corpulence, quarrelled for by princes, being renowned
for voracity. He had greatly diverted His Holiness the Pope
by devouring the third part of a bishop's cassock, cut in
pieces, and steeped in vinegar. Now at a signal from the
duke a huge platter of '<i>buzecchio</i>'&mdash;tripe stewed with quinces&mdash;was
placed before the friar. He sighed, crossed himself,
rolled up his sleeves, and consumed it with relish and
incredible rapidity.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'If thou had'st dined with Christ when He divided</p>
<p>&nbsp;The loaves and fishes miracle provided,</p>
<p>&nbsp;No morsel had remained a dog to fill,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Whilst thou unsatisfied had'st hungered still,'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>sang Bellincioni on the spur of the moment. Roars of
laughter broke from the company. Only the face of the
lonely and taciturn Leonardo retained its expression of
resigned <i>ennui</i>.</p>

<p>When the concluding dish of gilded oranges had been
served on silver plates, and handed with Malvoisie, then
Antonio Camella da Pistoja, a court poet, recited an ode
in which the duke was addressed by the Arts and Sciences
and Elements in these terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>'We were slaves; thou camest, and we are free. <i>Evviva
il Moro</i>.'</p>

<hr class="chap"/>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>After supper the guests adjourned to the garden called
'The Paradise'; laid out in geometrical figures with shorn
edgings of box, alleys of laurel and myrtle, shaded walks,
labyrinths, loggias, and woven arbours. Rugs and silken
pillows were thrown on a lawn freshened by a glittering
fountain. The ladies and their cavaliers grouped themselves
with relaxing ceremony before the little court theatre,
and an act of the '<i>Miles Gloriosus</i>' of Plautus was
performed. It was tedious, but the audience, out of reverence
for the ancients, feigned attention. After the comedy
the young people played ball, tennis, and blind-man's-buff,
running about, laughing and catching each other like
children among the luxuriant and fragrant roses and orange-trees,
while the elders were at dice, draughts, and chess.
Others of the company gathered in a close circle on the steps
of the fountain, and told <i>novelli</i> after the fashion of the
youths and ladies of the <i>Decameron</i>.</p>

<p>Then they danced to the tune of the favourite air of
'Lorenzo dei Medici':&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">'Quant e bella giovinezza</p>
<p class="i4">&nbsp;Ma si fugge tuttavia</p>
<p class="i4">&nbsp;Chi vuol esser lieto, sia</p>
<p class="i4">&nbsp;Di doman non c'è certezza.'</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>(Fair-fleeting Youth must snatch at happiness;</p>
<p>He knows not if to-morrow curse or bless.)</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>After the dance Madonna Diana, a gentle girl with a
pale and lovely face, sang to the low notes of the lute a
plaint on unrequited love. As by enchantment the noise
and the laughter ceased, and all listened with thoughtful
and reminiscent attention. It was long before any one
spoke, and after the ending of the song the hush was broken
only by the quiet rustling of the fountain. But presently the
voices and the mirth and the music awoke again, and were to
be heard till late at night, when the laurels were lighted by
fireflies, and in the darkened heaven reigned the new-born
moon. And over all the Paradiso floated a soft air, rich
with perfume of orange-blossom; and still trembled the notes
of the Medicean canzone:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The duke saw a glimmer of light in one of the four palace
towers. It was the lamp of Messer Ambrogio da Rosate,
prime astrologer, and a member of the Secret Council, who
was observing the conjunction of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn
in the sign of Aquarius, a matter of profound significance for
the house of Sforza.</p>

<p>As if pricked in his memory, the duke hastily saluted
Madonna Lucrezia, with whom he had been engaged in
tender discourse, and entered the palace. He looked at the
clock, and having awaited the precise minute and second
enjoined by the astrologer, swallowed a rhubarb pill, and
consulted a calendar in which he read the following note:&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>August 5th.</i>&mdash;Eight minutes past ten of the evening, pray
heartily on your knees, after folding your hands and raising
your eyes to Heaven.'</p>

<p>Fearing to be late, and so miss the prescription's efficacy,
he hurried to the chapel, unlighted save by a single lamp
before a picture. The duke loved the picture; it was by
Leonardo, and represented Cecilia, Countess of Bergamini,
arrayed like the Madonna, blessing a hundred-petalled
rose. He counted eight minutes by the hour-glass, sank on
his knees, folded his hands, and recited the <i>Confiteor</i>. He
prayed long and fervently, his eyes on the picture.</p>

<p>'Mother of God,' he murmured, 'protect, save, and have
mercy on me, on my son Massimiliano, and Cesare, the newly-born.
I commend unto thee Beatrice, my consort, and
Madonna Cecilia. And likewise Gian Galeazzo, my nephew,
for thou see'st my heart, and knowest that I wish no evil to my
nephew, though it may be that his death would set free not
only my state, but all Italy.'</p>

<p>Here he remembered the proof of his right to his throne
which he had obtained from the jurisconsult, and which
stated that his elder brother (father of Gian Galeazzo) having
been born unto Francesco Sforza, the condottiere, before
he became Francesco Sforza and Duke of Milan, whereas
Ludovico was born unto the said Francesco <i>after</i> he had
become duke&mdash;the younger not the elder was obviously the
heir to the ducal dignities of the common father.</p>

<p>At this moment, however, the decision seemed to Ludovico
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
rather ingenious than convincing. He hesitated to put it
before the Mother of God, contenting himself thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>'If in anything I have sinned or shall sin before thee, O
Queen of Heaven, thou knowest that I do so not for myself
but for the good of my people and of Italy. Mediate for me
with God, and I will glorify thee by the building in splendour
of the cathedral in this town of Milan, and of the Certosa at
Pavia, and of other glorious monuments.'</p>

<p>After his prayer, candle in hand, he went toward his bedchamber,
passing through the dark rooms of the sleeping
palace. In one of them, however, he encountered Madonna
Lucrezia.</p>

<p>'Truly, the god of Love favours me!' he thought.</p>

<p>'Signore!' exclaimed the girl; her voice broke, she would
have thrown herself on her knees before him, as she added,
'have pity on me, my lord!'</p>

<p>And she told him that her brother Matteo Crivelli, chief of
the chamberlains, a man of abandoned life but whom she devotedly
loved, had lost at play great sums of the public money.</p>

<p>'Fear not, madonna! I will save your brother.'</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, and added with a deep sigh:&mdash;</p>

<p>'And you too, O madonna, will you not be to me less cruel?'</p>

<p>She looked questioningly at him with serene and innocent
eyes.</p>

<p>'I do not understand you, signore. What is your meaning?'</p>

<p>Her modesty rendered her yet fairer.</p>

<p>'It means, my sweet,' he said, throwing his arm almost
roughly round her, 'it means&mdash;but, Lucrezia, have you not
seen that I love you?'</p>

<p>'Loose me! Let me go! What do you, signore! Madonna
Beatrice&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Shall not know!' said the duke.</p>

<p>'No, my lord, no. She is so good, so generous to me.
Leave me, for pity's sake&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I will save your brother&mdash;do all your desire&mdash;be your slave.
Only have pity on me.'</p>

<p>And half-sincere in his passion and his tears, he murmured
in trembling tones those lines of the poet's:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'I sing, poor swan, of my consumèd years,</p>
<p>&nbsp;But singing brings my torture no relief;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Love with his laughter blows the flame of grief,</p>
<p>&nbsp;And mocking cries, "Extinguish it with tears."'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
'Let me go! Let me go!' said the girl desperately.</p>

<p>But he bent over her, feeling the freshness of her breath,
the perfume of violet and musk, and forcibly kissed her on
the lips. For one moment Lucrezia languished in his
embrace, then, with a despairing cry, broke from him and
fled.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Having reached the nuptial apartment, he found the lamp
extinguished, and Beatrice already reposing in the huge,
mausoleum-like couch on a dais in the middle of the floor
under a blue silk baldachin. It was adorned with silver
curtains, and a coverlet, costly as the vestment of a priest, of
cloth of gold and pearls.</p>

<p>'Bice,' he whispered caressingly; 'Bice, dost thou sleep?'
and he would have saluted her, but she repulsed him.</p>

<p>'Bice&mdash;why is this?'</p>

<p>'Leave me in peace; I am fain of sleep.'</p>

<p>'But why, dear one, why? If thou knew'st how I adore
thee!'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, I know you adore us all together. Your consort,
and Cecilia, and <i>perdio</i>! the Muscovy slave-woman, the red-haired
fool whom you kissed in the obscurer angle of my
wardrobe room!'</p>

<p>''Twas a jest.'</p>

<p>'A jest I care not for.'</p>

<p>'Alas, Bice, these many days thou hast been harsh to
me! Well, I confess it&mdash;I am guilty; 'twas a scurvy jest&mdash;a
caprice.'</p>

<p>'Your caprices, my lord, are many.'</p>

<p>She turned towards him angrily. 'How is it you have
no shame? Why, why these lies? Do I not know you?
&mdash;read you to the soul? I would not have you think this
jealousy; but I will not, hear you, my lord?&mdash;I <i>will not</i> be
one among your lemans.'</p>

<p>'I swear to thee, Bice, I have loved none save thee. By my
soul's eternal weal, I swear it.'</p>

<p>She was silent, surprised less by his words than by the tone
in which they were uttered. He was not wholly lying. The
more he deceived her the more he felt he loved her, as if
passion were inflamed by fear, qualms of conscience, pity,
and remorse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
'Pardon, Bice, pardon,' he implored; 'consider my love
for thee&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>She submitted herself; and as he embraced her, invisible
in the darkness, he remembered serene and innocent eyes,
and a perfume of freshness, of violet and musk; the two
loves confused themselves in an exquisite sensation.</p>

<p>'Truly to-day thou art something like a lover!' she said
with inward pride.</p>

<p>'Of a truth, dear one; it is still as it was in our first
days&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Foolishness!' cried Beatrice laughing; 'Fie on this trifling.
Rather should'st thou be thinking of deeper matters.
It seems as though <i>his</i> health were mending.'</p>

<p>'Nay, 'tis but few days since Luigi Marliani assured me
there was no hope for him,' replied the duke; ''tis true we
have now a little amendment, but it will not be for long; he
is doomed beyond remission.'</p>

<p>'Who can tell?' urged Beatrice; 'he is over-tended. Of
a truth, Ludovico, I marvel at your patience. You bear
insults like a sheep. You say "The power is in our hands,"
but were it not better to renounce power at once than to
tremble for it night and day like thieves; to lick the dust
before that haughty bastard who is the King of France; to
be slaves at the mercy of the impudent Alfonso; to weary
ourselves in propitiating that perfidious sorceress of Aragon!
They say she is pregnant again: a new serpent will come
forth from that cursed nest. And to fare thus for our whole
lives! Consider, Ludovico, for our whole lives! And you
call that having the power in our own hands!'</p>

<p>'But the physicians constantly aver,' repeated the duke,
'that this malady is incurable; sooner or later&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ay, 'tis later then. For ten years he hath been dying.'</p>

<p>There was a silence. Suddenly she threw her beautiful
arm round his neck, and drawing herself to him, she whispered
in his ear&mdash;words which made him shudder.</p>

<p>'Bice! may Christ and His most holy Mother pardon
thee! Never&mdash;dost heed me?&mdash;never again speak to me
of that.'</p>

<p>'You are afraid, perhaps? Would you wish <i>me</i> to try?'</p>

<p>He did not answer, but asked presently:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Of what thinkest thou?'</p>

<p>'My lord,' she answered, 'I am thinking about peaches.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
'Ay; I have bidden the gardener send thee of the ripest.'</p>

<p>'I care not for them. My thought was of the peaches of
Messer Leonardo. Hast thou heard aught of those?'</p>

<p>'What should I have heard?'</p>

<p>'That they be poisoned.'</p>

<p>'How poisoned?'</p>

<p>''Tis true. He hath poisoned them himself, by magic, for
his experiments. Monna Sidonia told me; wonderfully
beautiful peaches!'</p>

<p>And again they were silent, embracing thus in the stillness
and the dark; their thoughts united, each listening to the
quickened beat of the other's heart&mdash;no further speech
needed. At last Il Moro, with almost paternal tenderness,
kissed his young wife on the brow, and made the sign of
the cross.</p>

<p>'Sleep, dear one,' he said, 'sleep in peace.'</p>

<p>That night the duchess saw in her dreams fair peaches on
a platter of gold. She proved one and found it succulent and
toothsome; but of a sudden a voice cried unto her:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Poison! poison!' and again, 'Poison!'</p>

<p>The duke likewise dreamed his dream. And in it he
fancied himself walking on the shining lawn beside the
fountain. And before him at a little distance he saw three
women, white-clad and embracing like fair sisters. And
nearing himself, he perceived the one to be Beatrice, and
the second Lucrezia, and the third Cecilia. He thanked
his God that at last they were friends; but in his heart he
blamed them that they had not been friends from the first.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>X</h3>

<p>The clock in the castle tower struck the hour of midnight,
and everywhere was the silence of sleep, saving only on the
<i>altana</i>, where the duchess was wont to gild her hair; for
thither Morgantina, the dwarf, had fled, having escaped from
the closet in which she had been confined: there, alone in
the darkness, she bewailed the loss of her baby.</p>

<p>'They have slain me my son! And wherefore, O Lord,
wherefore? He had done no wrong to any one; he alone
comforted me!'</p>

<p>The night was serene; the air so pure, so transparent, that
against the horizon the icy summits of the Alps were visible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
like everlasting crystals. The stillness was long perturbed
by the mournful cries of the madwoman, like the keening of
some bird of evil omen. Suddenly she gave a sigh, raised
her eyes to heaven, and was silent.</p>

<p>The stillness of death followed; and the fool smiled at the
stars which, far above in the measureless blue of a summer
night, were shining upon her&mdash;innocently and mysteriously
shining.</p>

<h3 class="p2">I</h3>

<p>In an obscure outskirt of Milan, near the Porta Vercellina,
the Customs House, and the canal called the Acqua Cantarana,
stood an old house, very solitary, and remarkable for the
smoke which day and night ascended in large spirals from an
immense, winding, and blackened chimney. Here dwelt
Monna Sidonia, the wise woman. The upper floor she
hired to Messer Galeotto Sacrobosco, an alchemist; and in
the lower she lived herself with Cassandra, his niece, the
young daughter of Luigi Sacrobosco, a celebrated traveller,
who had traversed Greece, the islands of the Archipelago,
Syria, Asia Minor, and Egypt, in the quest for specimens
of ancient art. He possessed himself of all that came to
hand: a Greek marble, or a trifle of amber, a sham inscription
from the tomb of Homer, a new tragedy by Euripides,
or a peroration by Demosthenes. Some thought him a great
man, but others dubbed him an impostor; and not a few
believed him crazy. His imagination was so enthralled by
pagan recollections that though to the last a good Catholic,
he prayed to the Olympian Hermes, and regarded Wednesday
(<i>Mercoledi</i>) his day, as one singularly propitious for
mercantile ventures. No toil, no privations, daunted him
in his enterprises. On one occasion, having already put out
ten leagues to sea, he returned to copy an inscription of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
which accident had informed him. Having lost his collection
in a shipwreck, his hair turned white with grief.
If asked why he so plagued himself and spent his days in
such sore labour, he always replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I desire to raise the dead.'</p>

<p>In the little town of Mistra, near the ruins of Lacedæmon,
he met a maiden of extraordinary beauty, resembling the
statues of Artemis. She was the daughter of a poor and
drunken village deacon; Luigi married her and took her
to Italy with a new copy of the Iliad, the fragments of a
Hecate, and the shreds of an earthenware amphora.</p>

<p>To the pair was born a daughter, whom they called Cassandra,
Luigi being at that time impassioned for Æschylean
tragedy. The wife died, and the father was off on his
wanderings, so the child was left to the care of Demetrius
Chalcondylas, a learned Greek from Constantinople who had
been brought to Milan by the Sforzas. This old man of
seventy, a double-faced, cunning, and secretive person, pretended
a vast zeal for the Catholic Church; in his heart,
however, like Cardinal Bessarione, and most of the immigrant
Greeks, he was a disciple of the last of the masters of the
ancient wisdom, Gemistus Pletho, the Replete with Learning,
the neoplatonist who had died forty years before at Mistra,
where Luigi had become enamoured of his Artemis. This
man had been affirmed by his disciples to be a re-incarnation
of the illustrious Plato himself; the theologians, on the
contrary, maintained that he had revived the anti-Christian
heresies of Julian the Apostate, and that he was to be fought
not by argument and controversy, but by the Inquisition
and the stake. Chiefly they accused him on account of
certain words uttered to his disciples three years before his
death. He had said: 'But a few years after I shall have
died, one sole Truth shall reign over all peoples and nations,
and men shall unite in the single faith' (<i>unam eandemque
religionem universum orbem esse suscepturam</i>). Being questioned
whether he meant the faith of Christ or of Mahomet,
he answered: 'Neither the one nor yet the other, but a faith
which in naught shall differ from the ancient paganism'
(<i>neutram, inquit, sed a gentilitate non differentem</i>).</p>

<p>Cassandra was bred by Chalcondylas in strict though
feigned Christian piety. Overhearing, however, much
neoplatonic talk, and not understanding its philosophical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
subtleties, the maid wove for herself a fantastic dream of the
coming Resurrection of the Gods. On her breast she wore
a talisman against fever, a present from her father; it was a
gem representing Dionysus as a naked youth, with thyrsus
and vine-branch, a rearing panther trying to lick the grapes
in his hand. Sometimes, when quite alone, she would hold
her amethyst up to the sun and gaze into its purple depths
until her head swam, and she saw the god in a vision, living,
and ever young and adorable.</p>

<p>Messer Luigi ruined himself at last in his quest for treasures,
and died miserably of a putrid fever in a shepherd's hut
beside the ruins of a Ph&oelig;nician temple, which he had himself
discovered. Soon after, Galeotto, his brother, who also
had wandered for many years in pursuit, not of antiquities
but of the philosopher's stone, came to Milan, established
himself in the little house by the Vercellina gate, and took
his niece to live with him.</p>

<p>She still, however, frequented the house of Chalcondylas,
and thither came Giovanni Boltraffio to execute some copying
for Messer Giorgio Merula.</p>

<p>Encountering Cassandra again, Giovanni remembered the
talk he had overheard between her and Zoroastro about the
poisoned tree, and he shuddered. Many told him the
maiden was a sorceress, but her charm was not to be
resisted, and almost every evening when his work was done
he sought her in the lonely cottage by the Vercellina gate.
They sat on a hillock together above the dark and silently
swift waters of the canal, not far from the sluice gates
near the convent of St. Radegonda. A scarce visible path,
tangled with elder-bushes, wormwood, and nettles, led to the
little hillock; no one ever passed that way, and there the two
met and loitered and talked long together.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>II</h3>

<p>It was a sultry evening; at rare intervals a gust came
flying, raising the white dust and rustling in the leaves. It
passed by, leaving the stillness stiller than before. Nothing
was heard but the dull, seemingly subterranean growl of
distant thunder, and against this low, threatening, and solemn
roar, the broken shrillness of a lute and the drunken song of
the customs-collector celebrating the Sunday feast in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
neighbouring tavern. At times a flash broke across the
clouds, and then for a moment the little house with the
brick chimney, and the black smoke of the alchemist's
furnace, the long lean sacristan fishing from the bank, the
straight canal with the rows of larches and willows, the flat-bottomed
barges from the Lago Maggiore bringing white
marble for the cathedral, and drawn by sorry horses, their
loose towing-ropes and the long whips of the drivers dipping in
the water&mdash;all stood out sharp and clear against the prevailing
blackness. All was again wrapped in gloom, save for the
alchemist's fire always vividly glowing. It was reflected in
the Cantarana, whence came noisome odours of stagnant backwaters,
rotting fern-leaves, tar, and decaying wood.</p>

<p>Giovanni and Cassandra were in their accustomed haunt.</p>

<p>''Tis tedious!' cried the girl, stretching herself wearily and
snapping her delicate white fingers behind her head; 'every
day the same dull round. To-day as yesterday, and to-morrow
as to-day. That same foolish sacristan catching
nothing; the same filthy smoke from Messer Galeotto's workshop,
where he, too, eternally seeks what he will never find;
the same boats towed by the same hateful horses; the same
cracked lute! Ah, if it would but change! If the French
would come and rid us of Milan! if the sacristan would
catch a fish, or my uncle find some gold. <i>Dio Mio!</i> what
weariness!'</p>

<p>'I know!' cried Giovanni. 'I also at times find life so
wearisome that I am fain to die. But Fra Benedetto taught
me a prayer very prevalent against the demon of discontent.
Shall I recite it for you?'</p>

<p>'Nay, Giovanni. It is long since I have been able to pray
to your God.'</p>

<p>'My God? What god is there but my God? the only
God?'</p>

<p>A quick flash, like the lightning of the storm, illumined her
face; never had it seemed to him so mystic, so unearthly, so
fair. She was silent for a time, passing her hand over the
dark aureole of her hair.</p>

<p>'Hearken, friend. It was long ago&mdash;yonder&mdash;in my native
land. I was scarce more than a babe. My father had taken
me with him on a journey. We visited the ruins of an
ancient temple. They stood high on a promontory; the sea
was around us and the screaming gulls; the waves were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
breaking endlessly on black rocks, sharp as needles, and
covered with salt foam, which rose and fell, running off the
sharp points of the rocks in a seething stream. He found a
half-faded inscription on the fragment of a marble slab. I
sat long alone on the temple steps, listening to the sea
and breathing in its freshness, mixed with the scent of the
sea-herbs. Then I went into the abandoned shrine. The
columns were yellow, but scarce crumbled by time, and
between them the azure sky seemed dark. There were
poppies growing in the crevices between the stones&mdash;pink
poppies&mdash;the poppies of Greece! It was quite still, but for
that muffled roar of the waves which filled the temple as if
with the voices of prayer. And I fell on my knees and
prayed to the god who had once been enshrined there&mdash;unknown
and now rejected by men. I kissed his marble
steps, and I wept and loved him because no one on earth
loved him any more, nor prayed to him&mdash;because he was
dead. Never since have I prayed so fervently! And that
temple&mdash;it was the temple of DIONYSUS!'</p>

<p>'By the love of God, Cassandra, what are you saying?
This Dionysus, whom you call God, exists not, nor did
exist.'</p>

<p>'Did he not?' cried the girl, scornfully; 'then why teach
the holy fathers, whom you reverence, that the gods, banished
in the days of the conquering Jesus, were changed into most
potent demons? How could Giorgio da Novara, the great
astronomer, learn by exact observation that the conjunction
of Jupiter with Saturn produced the teaching of Moses; with
Mars, that of the Chaldeans; with Venus, that of Mahomet;
with Mercury, that of Christ; and that conjunction with the
moon&mdash;future for him&mdash;would bring the teaching of Antichrist
and the Resurrection of the Gods?'</p>

<p>The storm was drawing nearer, the thunder roared louder,
the flashes grew ever brighter, heavy clouds were spreading
overhead, yet still the broken lute sobbed forth its insistent
melody on the threatening air.</p>

<p>'O madonna!' cried Boltraffio clasping his hands, 'do
you not see that 'tis the devil who is tempting you that he
may lure you to the abyss! Eternal curses upon him!'</p>

<p>The girl turned, laid both hands on his shoulders, and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>'And does he not tempt you also? Why did you leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
your sainted teacher, Benedetto? Why did you enter into
the school of the impious Leonardo? What brings you
hither unto me? Do you not know I am a witch? Are you
not affrighted lest you lose your soul talking here with me?'</p>

<p>'The strength of the Lord defend us!' he stammered,
shuddering.</p>

<p>She silently drew near him, fixing him with her wondrous
eyes. At that moment the lightning rent the cloud and
flashed on her pale face. Was she the goddess who had
risen before Giovanni's awestruck gaze from her tomb on
the Hill of the Mill?</p>

<p>''Tis she!' he thought in terror. 'She has found me
again, the White She-devil!'</p>

<p>He would have risen, but his forces seemed to have left
him. He felt the girl's hot breath on his cheek, and listened
as she whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Will you that I reveal everything to you? Will you fly
with me thither where He is? Ah, it is good there! <i>There</i>
is no weariness; nothing maketh ashamed. There all things
are permitted as in Paradise!'</p>

<p>A cold sweat broke out on Giovanni's brow, but curiosity
impelled him, and in a low voice he asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Where?'</p>

<p>'<i>Al Sabbato!</i>' she answered with passionate languor, her
lips almost touching his cheek.</p>

<p>A peal of thunder, now quite overhead, shook earth and
sky, rolling through the air in majestic reverberation, like the
laugh of unseen giants. Then slowly it died away into the
great silence.</p>

<p>And then rang out the melancholy peaceful sound of the
convent bell, the evening Angelus. Giovanni made the sign
of the cross.</p>

<p>'It is late,' said the girl rising; 'I must return homeward.
Do you see those torches, there on the road? 'Tis the duke
coming to visit Messer Galeotto, who is to show him an
interesting experiment with lead. He thinks it can be turned
into gold.'</p>

<p>True it was, the tramping of hoofs was heard coming from
the Porta Vercellina. Cassandra lingered for a moment, then
darted through the tangled elder-bushes and disappeared.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Messer Galeotto had consumed his whole life in the search
for the philosopher's stone. Having finished his medical
course at Bologna University, he had entered as <i>famulus</i> the
service of Count Bernardo Trevisani, renowned as an adept
in the occult sciences. Afterwards, for fifteen years, he had
sought the transforming mercury in all possible substances;
in volatile salts, bismuth, arsenic, human blood, gall,
and hair, in animals and plants. In this fashion the six
thousand ducats of his patrimony had been dissipated in the
smoke which ascended from his chimney. He must needs
live on the wealth of others. Money-lenders cast him into
prison; he escaped; and for eight years experimented
with eggs, destroying some twenty thousand. Next he
studied copperas with Maestro Enrico, the papal pronotary,
fell ill from the poisonous fumes, lay in bed for fourteen
months, and, deserted by every one, came near dying.
Having endured all humiliations and persecutions, starvation,
beggary, contempt, and even judicial torture, he wandered as
an itinerant artificer through France, Spain, the countries of
the Empire, Holland, Greece, Persia, Palestine, Northern
Africa. At last, old and worn out, but not yet disillusioned, he
returned to Lombardy, where Il Moro promised him the office
of court alchemist.</p>

<p>At Milan, in the lonely cottage by the Porta Vercellina,
he had set up his laboratory. It was a large chamber, in
the middle of which was a clumsy stove of fire-proof earth
divided into compartments, and fitted with valves, crucibles
and bellows. In one corner of the room was a pile of refuse.
The working-table was heaped with every sort of complicated
apparatus, cubes, rectifiers, receivers, retorts, funnels, mortars,
test-tubes, bottles, baths. A pungent smell was given off by
poisonous alkalis and acids. Here the seven gods of
Olympus, the seven heavenly planets, a whole occult and
mystic universe had its counterpart in metal: the sun in
gold, the moon in silver, Venus in brass, Mars, iron, Saturn,
lead, Jupiter, tin, and Mercury in quicksilver. Here were
substances with barbaric names which struck terror into the
profane. Here were wolf's milk, the iron of Achilles, anacardines,
asterites (clear-shining stones, having in the midst
an image of a full moon), androgyna, and rhaponticum,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
aristolochia or hart-wort (for giving ease in childbirth); and a
priceless drop of the blood of a lion which had cost years to
obtain, a gem, red as a ruby, which cures all diseases and
blesses with eternal youth.</p>

<p>At his table sat the alchemist, meagre, small, wrinkled as
an old mushroom, but still alert and tireless. His head supported
on his two hands, Messer Galeotto was gazing intently
at a retort, in which with low noise and bubbling was burning
oil of Venus, a clear green fluid. The candle that burned
by the philosopher's side sent an emerald light through the
retort on an ancient parchment folio, a work by the Arab
chemist Djabira Abdallah.</p>

<p>Hearing voices and footsteps on the stair, Galeotto rose,
threw a glance round the laboratory to make sure all was
ready, signed to his silent <i>famulus</i> to throw fuel on the
furnace, and sallied forth to meet his guests.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>They were a merry company of knights and dames, just
risen from supper and Malvoisie. Leonardo was there, and
Marliani, the court physician, a man profoundly versed in
alchemy. The ladies entered, and the quiet cell of the
student was filled with perfumes, with the rustle of silk, with
light chatter and laughter like the hum of birds. One damsel
overturned a retort with her hanging sleeve, another meddling
with a piece of iron slag cut her dainty glove, another
spilt the mercury on the table and screamed with delight on
seeing the living silver drops.</p>

<p>'And shall we really see Messer Satan in the fire at the
moment of the lead's conversion?' asked Madonna Filiberta
of her Spanish lover; 'is it not a sin to assist at such experiments?'</p>

<p>The alchemist whispered in Leonardo's ear:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Believe me, Messere, I hold myself much honoured by
your visit.' And he warmly clasped his hand, adding before
Leonardo could respond:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, I know, I know! 'Tis a secret from the crowd; but
we understand each other, do we not?'</p>

<p>Then with a smile of great affability he said aloud:&mdash;</p>

<p>'With licence from my most illustrious protector, the renowned
duke, and of all these loveliest ladies, I will adventure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
now to exhibit the divine metamorphosis. Will you all condescend
to lend me your honourable attention?'</p>

<p>First he showed his crucible, a melting-pot with thick sides
of fire-proof clay; he begged each one to examine it, and
tap it, and convince himself there was no concealed deception,
while he animadverted on the frauds of pretended philosophers
who were wont to have vessels with false bottoms in which
gold had been placed, not made. He also craved inspection
of the pewter, the fuel, the bellows, and all else, to prove
his good faith. Then the lead was chopped into small
pieces and consigned to the crucible, which was then put on
the hottest place of the furnace. The silent, cross-eyed
<i>famulus</i>&mdash;so pale, corpse-like and surly, that one of the ladies
near fainted, believing him the expected Messer Satan&mdash;began
to work a huge pair of bellows, and the fire quickly leaped
into flame. Galeotto meanwhile entertained his visitors with
conversation, and awakened general mirth by calling his science
of alchemy <i>casta meretrix</i>, who had many lovers but deluded
them all, offered easy conquest to everybody, but had so far
yielded to the embraces of none.</p>

<p>Luigi Marliani, the court physician, a fat, taciturn, gloomy
man with a dignified and intelligent face, lost patience with
this chatter, and wiping his brow, cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Messer Galeotto, methinks 'tis time for business. Your
metal is already bubbling.'</p>

<p>Galeotto opened a little blue paper packet which contained
a bright yellow powder, viscous and sparkling, like
highly polished glass. It had a strong smell of burnt sea-salt.
This was the momentous tincture, the long-sought, priceless
jewel of alchemy, the wonder-working <i>lapis philosophorum</i>.</p>

<p>With the point of a knife he detached a speck of the powder
no larger than a turnip-seed, wrapped it in a ball of bees-wax,
and tossed it into the boiling pewter.</p>

<p>'And what do you consider the strength of that solution?'
asked Marliani.</p>

<p>'One to two thousand eight hundred and twenty of the
metal to be converted,' replied Galeotto. 'Naturally my
solution is not yet perfected, but shortly, I hope, the figures
will be one to a million. Then it will suffice to take of it the
weight of a grain of millet, to dissolve it in a barrel of water containing
the parings of a hazelnut; and finally, to sprinkle
your vines therewith; in result you will have your vintage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
in May. <i>Mare tingerem si Mercurius esset.</i> I would turn the
sea into gold had I competency in quicksilver.'</p>

<p>Marliani turned away with a shrug. This bombast infuriated
him, and he hinted the impossibility of such transformations
by arguments supported by Aristotle.</p>

<p>'Have patience, <i>domine magister</i>,' said Galeotto with a
smile; 'in a little space I will propound to you such a syllogism
as not all your logic can confute.'</p>

<p>Therewith he threw a handful of white powder in the fire.
Clouds of thick smoke filled the laboratory. Hissing and
crackling, up leapt a many-coloured flame, changing like a
rainbow from blue to green, from red to yellow. The spectators
were alarmed, and Filiberta afterward swore that at the
instant the flame was purple, she saw in it the face of the
Devil. The alchemist with a long hooked iron raised the lid
of the crucible. The metal, white-hot, bubbled and hissed and
gurgled. Then the lid was replaced; the bellows soughed
and whistled, and when ten minutes later a thin iron rod was
dipped into the molten liquid, all saw hanging on its end a
yellow drop.</p>

<p>'Ready!' cried the alchemist.</p>

<p>The pot was now removed from the furnace and allowed to
cool. Then before the astounded spectators, there fell from
it, sparkling and resounding on the earthen floor, a bar of gold.
The alchemist pointed dramatically, and exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>Solve mihi hunc syllogismum!</i>'</p>

<p>'Unheard of! Incredible! Against all the laws of nature
and of logic!' murmured Marliani in stupefaction.</p>

<p>The face of Galeotto was white, his eyes glowed with the
fire of inspiration, and looking up to heaven, he cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>Laudetur Deus in æternum!</i> Praise God in eternity who
deigns to give part of his infinite power unto us, the most
abject of his creatures.'</p>

<p>The gold was tested with sulphuric acid. It proved to be
purer than the finest of Hungary or Arabia. The company
pressed about the venerable philosopher, congratulating him,
and wringing his hands. Il Moro took him aside.</p>

<p>'You serve me in fidelity and truth, Messer Galeotto?'</p>

<p>'I would I had more lives than one, that I might dedicate
them all to your Excellency,' replied the alchemist.</p>

<p>'Then, Galeotto, beware lest any of the other princes&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'<i>Illustrissimo</i>, if there be one of them who shall get even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
a scent of it, have me hanged for a hound.' And after a
pause he added, bowing very low, 'I would pray of your
Excellency&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What? Again?'</p>

<p>'God is my witness, 'tis for the last time.'</p>

<p>'How much?'</p>

<p>'Five thousand ducats.'</p>

<p>The duke reflected, reduced the sum by a thousand, and
promised. It was now late; Madonna Beatrice might be
anxious; the company hastened to take their leave, each one
receiving from the alchemist a fragment of the new-made
gold. Only Leonardo remained behind.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>V</h3>

<p>When they were alone Galeotto said to him, 'Well, Master,
what think you of my experiment?'</p>

<p>'The gold was in the rods,' replied Leonardo dryly.</p>

<p>'What rods? What do you mean, Sir?'</p>

<p>'The rods with which you stirred the molten metal. I
saw all.'</p>

<p>'Did you not yourself examine all my utensils?'</p>

<p>'These rods were not those we examined.'</p>

<p>'Not those! Master, permit me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Have I not told you I saw everything?' repeated Leonardo
with a smile. 'Be not obstinate, Galeotto. The gold was
concealed in hollow rods tipped with wood. When the
wooden ends were consumed in the molten mass, the gold fell
into it.'</p>

<p>The old man's legs shook; over his face spread a look at
once abject and pathetic. Leonardo touched him on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>'Fear not, Messer Galeotto, none shall know. I am no
tale-bearer.'</p>

<p>The impostor seized his hand feverishly and cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>'You will not betray me?'</p>

<p>'No. I wish you no ill. But, Messer Galeotto, why these
frauds?'</p>

<p>'Oh, Messer Leonardo,' cried the other, and immediately
the boundless despair in his eyes was transfigured by a flash
of hope, 'I swear to you by God, that if I seem to have
practised deception, 'tis but for the welfare of the duchy, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
the triumph of science, and because my deception shall
endure but a brief space. For, Messer Leonardo, truth it is
that I have verily found the philosopher's stone. I do not
assert that I have it yet in my possession, but I know that it
already exists. That is to say, it as good as exists; for I
have found the way, and you know that the way is everything.
Three or four more experiments, and lo! it is accomplished.
What was I to do, Messere? Is not the discovery of so
grand a truth justification for so small a deception?'</p>

<p>'Nay, Messer Galeotto,' replied Leonardo gravely, 'to
what purpose would you play with me at blind-man's-buff?
You know right well, even as I know, that the transmutation
of metals is a baseless dream: that there is no philosopher's
stone, nor can be one. Alchemy, necromancy, black magic,
all these sciences not founded on mathematics and exact
experiment are delusion or deception&mdash;flags of charlatans,
swelled but by the bellying of the wind, after which runs the
gaping herd, applauding it knows not what.'</p>

<p>His eyes round and bright with astonishment, the alchemist
hung on the lips of the master, and when Leonardo stopped
he did not reply. Presently, however, he nodded his head
intelligently and winked.</p>

<p>'Ah! ah! Messer Leonardo, but this will not serve. Am
I not of the initiated? And do we not all know that thou
thyself art the prince of alchemists, the possessor of the most
recondite mysteries of nature, the new Hermes Trismegistus,
the new Prometheus.'</p>

<p>'I?'</p>

<p>'Thou thyself, Master.'</p>

<p>'Call you this jesting, Messer Galeotto?'</p>

<p>'Contrariwise. 'Tis you, Messer Leonardo, who would jest.
How astute and impenetrable you are! In my time I have
seen many who were jealous of their secrets of science, never
an one like you.'</p>

<p>Leonardo looked at him searchingly; he strove in vain to
be angry. He smiled involuntarily.</p>

<p>'Do you seriously believe in these arts?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Do I believe in them? Messere, if God Himself came to
me hither at this moment and said to me: "Galeotto, there is
no philosopher's stone," I should answer him: "Lord, even as
it is true that thou hast created me, so is it true that there is
that stone, and that I shall find it."'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
After this Leonardo disputed no more, but listened with
interest to the speculations of the alchemist. Presently the
talk swerved to the possible assistance of the Devil in the
occult sciences; the old man, however, would none of this.
He declared the Devil to be the weakest, the most miserable,
the most impotent of all the creations of God; he himself
had faith only in the human mind, and believed that to
science all things were possible.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, without any consciousness of an abrupt
transition, and as if playing with some agreeable and diverting
recollection, he asked whether Messer Leonardo had
frequent apparitions of elemental spirits. And when his
interlocutor confessed to never having seen any, Galeotto
again refused to believe him; and with relish told how
the salamander has a body a finger and a half in length,
spotted, thin, and harsh, while the sylphide is blue as the
sky, transparent, and ethereal. He spoke also of the nymphs
and undines that live in the rivers and the sea; of the
gnomes, pygmies, and underground dwarfs; of the durgans
and dryads, dwellers in trees, and the rare spirits that inhabit
precious stones.</p>

<p>'I cannot convey to you,' concluded Galeotto, 'how beneficent
and exquisite are these genii!'</p>

<p>'Why, then,' asked Leonardo, 'do they appear only to the
elect?'</p>

<p>'Would you have them appear to all? They dread
vulgar persons, libertines, materialists, drunkards, and
gluttons. They affect the innocent, the childlike, simple
ones. They live only where there is no malice nor cunning.
Timid and fearful as gazelles they take refuge from human
eyes in their native elements.'</p>

<p>And a smile of infinite tenderness illuminated the old
man's face, as if at the memory of long-ago dreams.</p>

<p>'What a charming old fool!' thought Leonardo, no longer
scornful, but ready to simulate participation in any scientific
absurdity to please this man, whom now he treated with
affectionate consideration, like a child.</p>

<p>They parted as friends; and the moment he was alone the
alchemist plunged into new experiments with the oil of
Venus.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>All this time Monna Sidonia, the mistress of the house,
and Cassandra sat before an immense open fireplace in the
room below Messer Galeotto's laboratory. Their supper of
coarse vegetables was stewing on the hearth, and the old
woman with unvarying motion of her wrinkled finger spun
the linen thread with her distaff. Cassandra watched her
idly, and thought:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Always the same thing. To-day as yesterday, to-morrow
as to-day. The cricket chirps, the mouse squeaks, the spindle
hums. There is a crackling in the dry sticks on the hearth,
and I smell turnips and garlic.'</p>

<p>Presently the old woman began prating in her usual way;
saying that she was not rich, whatever the people might say
about her money-pot buried in the vineyard. That was all an
idle tale. The truth was, she was ruining herself for Galeotto
and his niece. She had too much heart, that was it, or she
would never keep them, the two of them hanging on to her
neck like a pair of millstones. And of a truth Cassandra
was no longer a child, and ought to be thinking of the future;
her uncle would die some day or other, and leave her as poor
as Job. She might at least get a husband. She might at
least accept the hand of the rich horsedealer at Abbiategrasso,
who had the folly to run after her. He was not young, but
he was a staid, God-fearing man without any bees in his
bonnet; had a good business and a mill, and an olive-press.
What more did she want?</p>

<p>Cassandra listened in silence; but tedium sat on her like
a nightmare; seized her by the throat and suffocated her.
She felt an irresistible longing to break out into rebellious
weeping and rage.</p>

<p>Monna Sidonia fished in the pot for a succulent turnip,
mashed it up with grape-juice, and munched with apparent
appetite; but the young girl, submissive though with growing
desperation, stretched herself and interlaced her fingers
behind her hair. After supper the old woman, like a wearied
Fate, nodded over her distaff, and her talk died down into
disconnected mumbling. Then Cassandra drew forth her
talisman, and the firelight shining through its purple depths,
she studied the figure of the naked god, and her heart
filled with love for the beautiful Hellenic deities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
She sighed heavily, concealed her amulet, and said diffidently:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Monna Sidonia! to-night at Barco di Ferrara and at Benevento
there is the gathering. Aunt! good kind aunt! we
will not dance. We will go only to see. We will come back
at once. I will do whatever you wish; I will even try to get
a present out of the horsedealer&mdash;only be kind for once.
Let us fly! let us fly together&mdash;now&mdash;at once!'</p>

<p>And the girl's eyes sparkled hungrily. The beldame surveyed
her curiously; then her blue and withered lips parted
in a smile which displayed her one tusk-like yellow tooth,
and her face lit up with a hideous joy.</p>

<p>'Ah, you wish it? Very much, do you? You have
caught the taste? Was there ever such a girl? For my
part, I am ready to fly every night. But see you here,
Cassandra, you take the sin on your own soul. To-night I
wasn't even thinking of it. I'll do it only for your sake, out
of my too great goodness of heart.'</p>

<p>Without haste the old woman went about the room, shut
the shutters, stuffed rags into the chinks, locked all doors,
poured water on the fire, lighted a black candle endued with
magical properties, and from an iron locker took an earthen
vessel containing a pungent ointment. She made show of
being deliberate and sensible, but her hands shook as though
she were drunk, her sunken eyes were at times turbid, at
times they sparkled like coals. Cassandra had dragged the
two great troughs used for the kneading of dough into the
centre of the room.</p>

<p>Now Monna Sidonia stripped herself, and sitting astride
of a broomstick on one of the troughs, she smeared herself
with the ointment which she had taken from the locker.
A hideous odour filled the room; the medicament, infallible
for making witches fly, was composed of poisonous lettuce,
hemlock, nightshade, mandragora, poppy, henbane, serpent's
blood, and the fat of unchristened children.</p>

<p>Cassandra could not look at the hag's deformity. At the
eleventh hour she recoiled.</p>

<p>'What are you about?' grumbled the crone; 'are you
going to leave me to fly alone? Come&mdash;make haste. Take
your clothes off.'</p>

<p>'All right. But, Monna Sidonia, put the light out. I can't
do it in the light.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
'Bah! what modesty! Never mind, there'll be no
modesty on the mountain.'</p>

<p>She blew out the candle, making the sign of the cross with
the left hand for the pleasing of the devil, her master.</p>

<p>Then the girl rapidly undressed, knelt in the trough, and
smeared herself.</p>

<p>In the darkness the old woman was heard mumbling the
senseless disconnected words of an incantation.</p>

<p>'Emen Hetan, Emen Hetan, Palu, Baalberi, Astaroth, help
us. Agora, Agora, Patrisa, come and help us!'</p>

<p>Cassandra eagerly snuffed the strong odour of the unguent.
Her skin burned; her head swam; delicious thrills ran down
her back. Red and green interlacing circles swam before
her eyes, she heard the abandoned stridulous voice of Monna
Sidonia as if from afar.</p>

<p>'Garr-r! Garr-r-r! Up! Up! Don't knock your head!
We fly! We fly!'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Forth from the chimney-top flew Cassandra astride on the
soft hide of a black goat. Ravished, panting, with exaltation
filling her soul, she screamed like a young swift, plunging for
the first time through the blue air.</p>

<p>'Garr-r! Up! Up! We fly! We fly!'</p>

<p>The deformed and withered body of Aunt Sidonia flew
beside her on a broomstick; her thin hair streaming in the
blast.</p>

<p>'To the north! To the north!' yelled the hag, managing
her broomstick like a horse.</p>

<p>Cassandra burst into peals of laughter, remembering poor
Messer Leonardo and his cumbrous mechanism.</p>

<p>Now she ascended, and the black clouds rolled together
beneath her; now they burned blue in the flashes of
jagged lightning. But above the clouds the sky was clear.
A full moon shone, huge and round as a millstone, and
so near she could touch it with her hand. Affrighted, she
guided the goat downwards again, and he plunged with her
headlong into the void.</p>

<p>'Devil of a wench, you'll break your neck,' screamed
Sidonia.</p>

<p>Now they were skimming so close to the ground that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
brushed the rustling meadow-grasses; will-o'-the-wisps guided
their course past old tree-trunks gleaming with rottenness;
while the owl, the bittern, and the goatsucker mourned
plaintively among the reeds.</p>

<p>Presently they flew across the summits of the Alps, their
icy spars glittering in the moonshine; and again they dropped
to the surface of the sea. Cassandra, scooping water in her
hand, tossed it in the air, and rejoiced in the sapphire
splashes.</p>

<p>Momently their pace increased, and they came up with
and distanced fellow-travellers; a sorcerer with long grey
hair, in a tub; an ecclesiastic on a muck-rake, red, gorbellied,
jovial as Silenus himself; a golden-haired, blue-eyed
lass on a broom, a young and red-haired vampire on a
grunting porker, and a hundred others.</p>

<p>'Whence come you, little sister?' cried Sidonia, and
twenty voices answered her.</p>

<p>'From Candia! From the Isles of Greece! From
Valenza! From the Brocken! From Mirandola, Benevento,
from the caves and the fjords!'</p>

<p>'Whither go ye?'</p>

<p>'To Biterne! To Biterne! For the marriage of the great
goat, the Buck of Biterne. Fly! Fly! Haste to the supper.'
And they passed over the dreary plain like a cloud of rooks
on a whirlwind. The moon shone purple, and against it in
the distance gleamed the cross upon a village church. The
vampire hurled herself against it, tore away the cross and the
great bell, casting them far off into the swamp, where they
sank with a despairing clang. The vampire barked like a
joyous dog, and the flaxen-headed lass on the cantering
broomstick clapped her little hands with glee.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The moon was now hidden by the clouds. Torches
flared with flames of green and blue, and upon the chalky
plateau the black shadows of the dancing witches spread and
wheeled and interlaced and disentwined.</p>

<p>'Garr-r! Garr-r! 'Tis the Sabbath! 'Tis the Sabbath!
From right to left! From right to left!'</p>

<p>They flew and they danced in their endless thousands like
the withered and perishing autumn leaves. In their midst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
sat Hircus Nocturnus, the great he-goat, enthroned upon
the mountain.</p>

<p>'Garr-r! Garr-r-r. Praise to the great Becco Notturno!
The Buck of Biterne! The Buck of Biterne! Our wars
are ended! Rejoice ye and rejoice!'</p>

<p>There was a screeching of pipes made of dead men's
bones; the drum, stretched with the skin of the hanged,
was beaten with the tail of a wolf. A loathsome stew was
boiling in a vast cauldron, not seasoned with salt, for salt
is abhorrent to the lord of that place.</p>

<p>Black were-cats were there dancing, lustful and emerald-eyed;
slender maidens white as lilies; a shapeless capering
incubus, grey as a spider; shuddering nuns; on a low bank,
a white-bodied, plump, gigantic witch, with a stupid and
good-natured face, was suckling two newly-hatched demons,
already greedy and malicious. Three-year-old children, not
yet admitted to the revelry, were feeding herds of toads,
dressed as cardinals, with the sacred Host in their claws.</p>

<p>Sidonia and Cassandra joined the dance which sucked
them in and whirled them away like a howling storm.</p>

<p>'Garr-r-r! from right to left! From right to left!'</p>

<p>Long wet whiskers like those of a walrus swept Cassandra's
neck; a thin winding tail tickled her face, she was impudently
pinched and bitten, hateful endearments were whispered in
her ears. She made no resistance; the wilder the merrier;
the more shameless the more intoxicating.</p>

<p>Suddenly petrifaction fell on the assembly; all voices
were hushed, all movement was arrested. From the black
throne, surrounded by terror, where sat the great Unknown,
came a dull hoarse roar, like the growl of an earthquake.</p>

<p>'Receive you my gifts! To the weak, my strength; my
pride to the humble; to the poor-spirited, my wisdom; to the
afflicted, my joy. Receive my gifts!'</p>

<p>Then an old man of venerable aspect, his grey beard
flowing&mdash;one of the fathers of the Holy Inquisition, at the
same time patriarch of the sorcerers, and celebrant of the
Black Mass, chanted in solemn tones:&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>Sanctificetur nomen tuum per universum mundum et libera
nos ab omni malo!</i> Be in awe, ye faithful ones, and fall
prostrate!'</p>

<p>They knelt, falling on their knees with a crash, and as
from one voice resounded the Sorcerer's Confession:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
'<i>Credo in Deum patrem Luciferum, qui creavit c&oelig;lum et
terram. Et in filium suum Beelzebub.</i>'</p>

<p>When the last sounds had died away, and there was renewed
stillness, the same voice of the Unknown, deafening as an
earthquake cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Bring hither my bride&mdash;my stainless dove!'</p>

<p>And the old man with the flowing beard inquired:&mdash;</p>

<p>'What is the name of thy bride, thy stainless dove?'</p>

<p>'Madonna Cassandra! Madonna Cassandra!' roared the
great voice.</p>

<p>Hearing the pronouncement of her name, the girl's blood
froze in her veins. Her hair stood erect.</p>

<p>'Madonna Cassandra! Cassandra!' rang the cry from the
crowd. 'Where hideth she? Where is our sovereign? <i>Ave
Arcisponsa Cassandra!</i>'</p>

<p>She hid her face and would have fled; but bony fingers,
claws, antennæ, and probosces, and the hairy legs of spiders
seized her; and dragged her trembling before the throne.
The rank odour of a goat, and a chill as of death smote her;
she closed her eyes in dread. Then he upon the throne
cried: 'Come!'</p>

<p>Her head hanging, she saw at her feet a fiery cross gleaming
through the darkness. She made a supreme effort, took a
step forward, and raised her eyes.</p>

<p>Then a miracle took place.</p>

<p>The goat's skin fell from him as the scales from a sloughing
snake; she was face to face with Dionysus the Olympian;
thyrsis and vine-branch in his hands, a smile of eternal
joy upon his lips, the panther at his feet pawing at the
grapes.</p>

<p>And the <i>Sabbato diabolico</i> changed into the divine orgies
of Bacchus; the witches became Mænads, the monstrous
demons were kindly goat-footed Satyrs; the chalk rocks
were colonnades of shining marble, lighted by the sun, and
between them in the distance was the purple sea. The
radiant gods of Hellas, surrounded by an aureole of fire, were
gathering in the clouds, and the Satyrs and the Bacchantes,
beating their timbrels, cutting their breasts with knives,
squeezing the grape-juice into goblets of gold, and mingling
it with their blood, danced and circled and sang:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Glory to Dionysus! Glory to Dionysus! The gods have
risen! Glory to the eternal gods!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
And Bacchus, the ever young, opened his arms to
Cassandra. His voice was like thunder, shaking earth and
sky as he cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Come hither my bride! my stainless dove!'</p>

<p>And she sank into the god's embrace.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>From the distance sang the morning cry of the cock, and
a sharp odour of fog and smoke greeted the nostrils. Slowly
through the air came the sound of a bell, and at this sound
the mountain was convulsed. Again the Mænads became
the monstrous hags, the Satyrs or Fauns were demons, and
the beautiful Dionysus resolved once more into the hideous
and fetid Hircus Nocturnus.</p>

<p>'Homewards! Fly! Escape!'</p>

<p>'They have stolen my muck-rake!' the gorbellied ecclesiastic
roared despairingly.</p>

<p>'Hog! return to me!' screamed the red-haired vampire,
shivering and coughing in the mountain damp.</p>

<p>The setting moon once more shone out from behind the
clouds, and in the pallid crimson of her light, the frightened
witches, swarm after swarm, like unclean flies, streamed away
from the mountain.</p>

<p>'Garr-r! Garr-r! Up from the depths! Do not knock
your heads. Save yourselves. Fly!'</p>

<p>The Becco Notturno, bleating lamentably, sank through
the earth, leaving the rotten and stifling odour of sulphur.
And slow and solemn the church bells sounded more triumphantly
through the purer air.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>X</h3>

<p>Cassandra returned to herself in the darkened chamber of
the little house by the Porta Vercellina. She was nauseated
as if after drunkenness. Her head was like lead; her body
broken with weariness.</p>

<p>The bell of St. Radegonda was tolling heavily and monotonously.
Outside some one was knocking insistently; someone
who had already knocked more than once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Cassandra listened, and recognised the voice of her suitor,
the horsedealer from Abbiategrasso.</p>

<p>'For the Lord's love, open, Monna Sidonia! Monna
Cassandra! Nay, then, are ye all gone deaf? I am wet
through; would ye have me turn back through this fury of
the elements?'</p>

<p>The girl dragged herself to her feet, crept to the shutters,
and pulled out the rags with which her aunt had wedged
them close. The dull light of a wet day streamed into the
room, and fell on the naked crone, still sleeping a deathly
sleep on the floor beside the trough, still stained with the
unguent, and snoring profoundly.</p>

<p>Cassandra peeped out. The weather was detestable; the
rain descending in torrents. Through the network of drops
she could see the impatient lover, beside him his little ass,
her head dolorously drooping as she leaned against the shafts
of the cart, in which a calf, its feet tied together, mooed
plaintively, stretching forth its muzzle.</p>

<p>The horsedealer getting no answer knocked louder than
ever, and Cassandra waited to see what would happen. At
last one of the laboratory windows opened, and the old
alchemist looked out, his face sullen, as it generally was in
the early morning.</p>

<p>'What's all this noise?' he cried; 'have you gone out of
your five wits, you old devil? Go to hell with you! Can't
you see we're all asleep? Take yourself off!'</p>

<p>'Why insult me thus, Messer Galeotto? I have come on
an affair of importance. I bring a present for your exquisite
niece&mdash;a sucking calf&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Go to the devil, blockhead,' cried Galeotto, 'you and
your calf!'</p>

<p>And the shutter was slammed to. The horsedealer stood
for a moment dumbfounded; then, recovering himself, he
knocked again, violently, as if he would smash the door with
his fists.</p>

<p>The donkey's head drooped still lower, the rain pouring in
streams off her long ears.</p>

<p>'God! how dull it all is!' murmured Cassandra, closing
her eyes. And she thought of the frenzy of the Sabbath, the
transformation of the Becco Notturno into Dionysus, the
resurrection of the old gods, and she asked herself:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Was it reality or dream? In good sooth, 'twas a dream,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
and this is the reality! After Sunday always there is&mdash;just
Monday!'</p>

<p>'Open! open!' yelled the horsedealer, hoarse and desperate.
And the raindrops plashed monotonously in the
miry pools, the calf bleated piteously, and the bell of the
neighbouring convent tolled on, with even and melancholy
strokes.</p>

<h3 class="p2">I</h3>

<p>Corbolo the shoemaker, a citizen of Milan, having returned
home one night over merry, received from his wife, as he
said, 'more blows than would have driven a tired ass from
Milan to Rome.' The next morning, when his spouse had
gone to her neighbour's to fetch the black pudding, Corbolo
rooted some concealed coins out of his pouch, left the shop
to his apprentice, and went off for a drink, to recover
himself.</p>

<p>His hands in the pockets of his threadbare breeches, he
sauntered along the narrow street&mdash;so narrow that a horseman
must needs prick the foot-passengers with his spurs&mdash;and
sniffed the eternal smell of oil, rotten eggs, sour wine,
and mouldy cellars. Whistling a tune, he looked up at the
narrow strip of blue sky between the roofs, and at the many-coloured
rags and torn garments stretched across the lane on
lines that they might be dried in the sun, and solaced
himself with his favourite proverb (of which, however, he
never took the advice), '<i>Mala femina, buona femina, vuol
bastone</i>.'</p>

<p>To shorten his road he passed through the cathedral,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
which was still in process of construction. Here there was
noise and bustle as in a market-place. From door to door,
notwithstanding the fine of five <i>soldi</i> imposed upon intruders,
there passed persons carrying wine, baskets, cases, trunks,
trays, planks, beams, bundles, some even leading asses and
mules. The priests were praying and chanting; lamps
burned on the altars, and murmurs came from the Confessional;
yet the boys played at leap-frog, the dogs barked and
fought, and sturdy beggars jostled each other in the quest for
alms. Corbolo stood for a space in the crowd, listening with
sly amusement to a dispute between two monks, a Franciscan,
and a Domenican, on the comparative claims of St. Francis
and St. Catharine to occupy the seat in heaven which had
been left vacant by the fall of Lucifer.</p>

<p>Corbolo's eyes blinked as he came out of the cathedral
gloom into the strong sunlight of the Piazza dell' Arrengo.
This was the liveliest part of Milan, crowded with the booths
of small vendors, and so overfilled with packing-cases and
rubbish, that foot passengers could hardly make their way.
From time immemorial these booths had lumbered the
square, and no laws nor penalties could expel them.</p>

<p>'Salad of Valtellina! lemons! oranges! artichokes! asparagus!'
cried the vegetable-seller.</p>

<p>The rag-wives babbled and cackled like brood-hens. A
donkey, almost concealed under a mountain of grapes,
oranges, cauliflowers, fennel, beetroot, tomatoes and onions,
brayed in lacerating tones:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Hee&mdash;ho&mdash;Hee&mdash;ho.' While his driver lustily thumped
his shrunken sides, and yelled forth his guttural:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Arri&mdash;Arri!'</p>

<p>A long string of blind persons with sticks, and guides,
chanted a doleful and tedious supplication. A street-dentist,
his hat ornamented with a chaplet of teeth, was standing
over a man whose head he held between his knees, and with
the rapid movements of a juggler, was drawing his teeth with
huge pincers. Children were spinning tops under the feet of
the pedestrians, and teasing a Jew with offers of a pig's head;
Farfanicchio, the leader of the scamps, had let a mouse loose
among the market-women. It rushed up the ample petticoats
of Barbacchia, the fruit-seller, who jumped up as if
she had been scalded, cursing the ragamuffins, and shaking
her garments regardless of propriety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
A porter, carrying a pig's carcase, turned round suddenly to
see the fun, and terrified the horse of Messer Gabbadeo, the
surgeon; it reared and plunged, and overturned a whole pile
of kitchenware in the booth beside it; saucepans, frying-pans,
skimmers, graters, rolled over with a deafening crash; the
horse bolted and carried away the terrified surgeon, his arms
round its neck, his great bass voice alternately imploring God
and the devil to rescue him. The dogs barked, curious faces
were thrust from windows; laughter, cries, curses, whistling,
shouting rose on all sides; and the donkeys brayed from
every side of the square.</p>

<p>Watching this diverting spectacle, the shoemaker said to
himself philosophically:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The world would be a good place enough, if it were not
for the women, who devour their husbands as rust devours
iron.'</p>

<p>Then shading his eyes with his hand, he looked up at the
vast unfinished pile surrounded with scaffolding. This was
the great cathedral, the magnificent temple which Milan was
erecting in honour of the Birth of the Virgin. All, small and
great, had contributed to the shrine. The queen of Cyprus
had sent a precious cloth embroidered with gold. Caterina,
the old rag-woman, had laid on the altar of the Virgin her
only cloak, worth twenty <i>soldi</i>. Corbolo, who from his
childhood had watched the progress of the building, saw this
morning a new pinnacle, and rejoiced.</p>

<p>All around was heard the tapping of mallets and hammers.
The immense blocks of sparkling marble brought from the
quarries on the Lago Maggiore were landed on the wharf at
Laghetto de Santo Stefano, not far from the Ospedale
Maggiore, and were still arriving at the building; cranes
creaked and rattled their chains, iron saws grated on the
marble, the workmen swarmed around the scaffolding like
flies. And daily the great temple was growing, with its countless
spires, its belfries and turrets of pure white gleaming
against the azure heavens; a perpetual hymn raised by the
people of Milan to the glory of Maria Nascente.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Corbolo descended by steep stairs from the piazza to a cool
arched cellar set with wine casks, of which the master was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
German named Tibaldo. The shoemaker greeted the company,
and sitting down by his friend Scarabullo the tinman,
ordered a flask of wine and hot pastry flavoured with thyme;
then he drank a long slow draught, filled his mouth, and
said:</p>

<p>'Scarabullo, if you desire wisdom, take unto yourself no
wife.'</p>

<p>'Why not?' demanded Scarabullo.</p>

<p>'Because, friend, to marry is to thrust your hand into a bag
of serpents in order to draw out an eel. Better have the
gout than a wedded wife, Scarabullo.'</p>

<p>At the table beside them, surrounded by a hungry and
credulous crowd, Mascarello, the jolly goldsmith, was singing
the praises of a fabulous land, where the vines are hung with
sausages, and a goose and a gosling together cost a single
penny; where there are mountains of cheese ready grated, and
<i>gnocchi</i> and macaroni are cooked in the fat of capons and
thrown to him who asketh; and <i>vernaccia</i>, the best white wine,
into which enters not one drop of water, springs from the soil
in a natural fountain. A little man named Gorgoglio, a glass-blower,
at this moment came running into the tavern: by
reason of the king's evil, his eyes were half-shut, like those of a
new-born puppy. He was bibulous and a great lover of
talk.</p>

<p>'Sirs, sirs!' he cried, raising his hat and wiping his streaming
face, 'I have seen the Frenchmen!'</p>

<p>'Gorgoglio, you dream. 'Tis impossible they be here yet.'</p>

<p>'I' faith, they be here; they are at Pavia. Let me but
breathe! 'Tis not weather for running, and I have run the
whole course to be first with the news.'</p>

<p>'Take my bottle. Drink and recount: of what sort be
these French?'</p>

<p>'A bad sort, friends; a very bad sort. Heaven defend us
from them! trust not your fingers in their mouths, friends.
Choleric, savage infidels, like ferocious brutes; in a word,
barbarians. They carry arquebuses eight braccia long, partisans
of brass, iron bombards which belch stones; their horses
are sea-monsters, shaggy, with docked ears and tails.'</p>

<p>'Be they many?'</p>

<p>'Ay, a crowd; they beset the plain as locusts; you can see
no end to them. The Lord hath sent them for the chastisement
of our sins, this Black Death, these northern devils.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
'But why, Gorgoglio, speak thus ill of them?' asked
Mascarello; 'they come as our friends&mdash;our allies.'</p>

<p>'Allies! Hold your peace. Look after your pockets, say
I, for that kind of ally is worse than an enemy. He'll buy the
horn and steal the bullock.'</p>

<p>'Rave not, Gorgoglio. Expound simply why you hold these
French inimical.'</p>

<p>'Because they trample down our crops; because they fell
our trees, carry off our beasts, ravish our women. Their king
is a baboon; no soul behind his teeth; but he is a great lover
of women. He carries a book, pictures of our handsomest
women. And they say that, God helping them, they will not
leave a maid between Milan and Naples.'</p>

<p>'The villains!' cried Scarabullo, thumping with his fist so
that the glasses rang.</p>

<p>'And our Moro,' continued Gorgoglio, 'dances on his hind
legs to the sound of the French pipe. And they don't count
us to be men, neither. "You," they say, making their grimaces,
"you are all thieves and assassins. You have poisoned your
rightful duke, you have murdered an innocent boy. For this
God punishes you and gives us your land." And we, friends,
are receiving them into our arms and feeding them!'</p>

<p>'These be old wives' tales, Gorgoglio.'</p>

<p>'Blind me, cut out my tongue if I speak not the truth!
Nor have I told all. Hearken, <i>signori miei</i>, to what they have
the audacity to say. They say "We are destined to overcome
all the peoples of Italy, to subdue all the seas and the nations
of the sea, to destroy the grand Turk, and plant the true cross
on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem; then we will come back
to you, and we will execute on you the fury of God. And if
you submit not yourselves, your name shall be wiped off from
the face of the earth." That's what they say!'</p>

<p>''Tis ill news,' sighed Mascarello the goldsmith. 'Unheard-of
news!'</p>

<p>The rest were silent.</p>

<p>Then Fra Timotea, the lean Domenican, who had been
disputing in the cathedral with Fra Cipolla about the saints
in glory, raised his hands to heaven and said solemnly:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Such were the words of Fra Girolamo Savonarola, that
great prophet of the Lord. "Behold," said he, "the man cometh
who is destined to conquer Italy without drawing the sword
from the scabbard. O Florence! O Rome! O Milan!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Past is the hour of feasting and of song! Repent ye, repent!
The blood of Gian Galeazzo, the blood of Abel which was
spilt by Cain, crieth for vengeance before the throne of God."'</p>

<hr class="chap"/>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>At this moment a brace of soldiers came in.</p>

<p>'The French! the French! See!' exclaimed Gorgoglio,
nudging his companions.</p>

<p>One of the newcomers was a Gascon; young, tall, and
shapely, with a handsome impudent face adorned by red
moustachios; a cavalry sergeant named Bonnivart. The
other old, fat, bull-necked, red-faced, swollen-eyed, ear-ringed,
was a gunner from Picardy named Groguillioche. Both were
a little drunk.</p>

<p>'<i>Sacrement de l'autel!</i>' said the sergeant slapping the others
on the back. 'Shall we at last find a mug of good wine
in this accursed town? The sour stuff of this Lombardy
burns my throat like vinegar.' And stretching himself on a
bench, and throwing a contemptuous glance at the company,
he rapped with his knuckles, and shouted in bad Italian:&mdash;</p>

<p>'White wine, dry, your oldest; and brain-sausage for the
first course!'</p>

<p>'You are right, comrade,' said Groguillioche; 'when I
think of our wine of Burgundy, of the precious <i>Beaune</i>
gold as my Lison's hair, my heart bursts with melancholy.
Most true is it: "Like people, like wine." Let us drink,
comrade, to the prosperity of our France.'</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Du grand Dieu soit mauldit à outrance</p>
<p>&nbsp;Qui mal vouldroit au royaume de France!'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>'What say they?' murmured Scarabullo into Gorgoglio's
ear.</p>

<p>'Scurvy talk!' said the latter. 'They praise their own
wine, and praise not ours.'</p>

<p>'Just look at those two French cocks,' grumbled the tinman;
'my hand itches to be at them.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tibaldo, the German host, with fat belly on
thin legs, and a formidable bunch of keys at his leathern
girdle, drew from the cask half <i>brentas</i> of wine, and served
them to the foreigners in an earthenware jug, looking most
suspiciously at his guests. Bonnivart drank his potion at one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
draught, and found it excellent: none the less, he spat,
making a face of disgust. Just then Lotte, Tibaldo's daughter
passed by; a slim, flaxen-haired little lass, with kind blue eyes
like her father's. The Gascon nudged his comrade, twirled
his moustaches seductively, drank, and trolled out a song, to
which Groguillioche added a husky chorus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Charles fera si grandes batailles</p>
<p>&nbsp;Qu'il conquerra les Itailles,</p>
<p>&nbsp;En Jerusalem entrera</p>
<p>&nbsp;Et mont Olivet montera.'</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Presently Lotte passed them again, modestly dropping her
eyes, but the sergeant caught her by the waist and tried to pull
her to his knee. She pushed him away, broke loose, and fled.
He jumped up, caught her and kissed her cheek, his lips still
wet with wine. The girl screamed, dropped the pitcher she
was carrying, and struck the Frenchman so hard a blow that
for a moment he was stunned, at which there was a general
laugh.</p>

<p>'Well done, wench!' cried the goldsmith. 'By St. Gervaso,
I ne'er saw a heartier smack, nor one more seasonably
applied.'</p>

<p>Groguillioche tried to restrain his companion.</p>

<p>'Let her alone. Don't make a fool of yourself,' he said.</p>

<p>But the Gascon was flown with wine, and, laughing with a
laugh that was but at one side of his mouth, he cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>'That's your way, is it, my beauty? <i>Ventre bleu!</i> next
time it shall not be on your cheek, but fair on your lips.'</p>

<p>Upsetting the table, he sprang after her, captured her, and
would have executed his threat, had not the powerful hand of
Scarabullo seized him by the throat.</p>

<p>'Ha! son of a dog! Hideous mug of a Frenchman! I'll
teach you how to insult the girls of Milan!' and he shook his
victim backwards and forwards, nearly choking him.</p>

<p>'<i>Sacrebleu! Sacrebleu!</i>' roared Groguillioche infuriated;
'hands off, ruffian! <i>Vive la France! St. Denis et St. George!</i>'
His sword was out, and prompt to be thrust into the tinman's
back, but Mascarello, Gorgoglio, Maso, and the rest intervening,
tied his hands. Now was utter confusion; tables
overset, benches smashed, casks rolling, shards of smashed
pitchers under the feet, everywhere pools of wine. Seeing
blood, naked swords, and brandished knives, Tibaldo rushed
into the street, and, in a voice fit to fill the square, yelled:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
'Assassination! Homicide! The French are sacking the
town!'</p>

<p>At once the market bell rang forth and was answered by
its brother of the Broletto. The dealers closed their shops.
Fruit-sellers and rag-wives ran hither and thither packing
their goods.</p>

<p>'San Gervaso and San Protaso! our protecting saints;
lend us aid!' cried the fat vegetable-woman with the tremendous
voice.</p>

<p>'What is on foot? What is happening? Is it a conflagration?'</p>

<p>'Down! Down with the Frenchmen!'</p>

<p>Farfannichio, the naughty boy, danced with delight, whistling
and yelling.</p>

<p>'Down with the Frenchmen! Down with the Frenchmen!'</p>

<p>Guards and soldiers now appeared on the scene, mighty
with arquebuses and pikes. They were just in time to rescue
Groguillioche and Bonnivart from death at the hands of the
mob. Laying hands right and left, they arrested amongst
others Corbolo the shoemaker.</p>

<p>His wife, who had run up on sound of the tumult, now
wrung her hands piteously, and wailed:&mdash;</p>

<p>'For pity's sake, let him go! Have mercy on my poor little
husband! I will chastise him at home, and never allow him
into a street squabble again. Believe me, Messeri, he is a
perfect natural, and not worth the rope you would hang him
with.'</p>

<p>But Corbolo, hanging his head, fixing his eyes on the ground,
and pretending not to hear these intercessions, hid behind
the stout person of one of the guards, who seemed to him far
less terrible than his spouse.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Right above the scaffolding of the unfinished cathedral, up
a narrow stair of rope to one of the slender pinnacles, not far
from the principal tower, a certain young mason clomb, bearing
a small statue of St. Catharine, to be fixed on the very top
of the little spire. Around him rose a perfect forest of pinnacles,
sharp-pointed like stalactites; spires, flying arches, stone lacework
of unexampled flowers and foliage, prophets, martyrs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
and angels, the grinning masks of devils, monstrous birds,
sirens, harpies, dragons with scaly wings and gaping mouths,
every sort of gargoyle at the terminals of the water-pipes.
All was of marble very pure and white, upon which the
shadows showed blue as smoke, the whole suggesting a
winter wood clothed in sparkling frost. It was quiet, save
that the swallows and swifts made joyous cries as they continually
circled above and around the building. The hum of
the crowd in the square reached the young mason like the
low murmur of an ant-hill. At times he fancied organ-notes
and prayerful sighs rose from the interior of the temple as
from the depth of its stony heart; and then it seemed as if
the whole vast edifice breathed and grew and heaved to the
sky like the eternal praise of the birth of Mary; like the glad
hymn of all ages and of all peoples to the Immaculate Virgin.</p>

<p>Suddenly the hum from the square increased in volume,
and an uproar became plain to the ear. The mason paused
in his work and looked down. Then his head swam and his
eyes grew dim. He felt the edifice rocking under him, and
the slender pinnacle towards which he was climbing bent like
a reed.</p>

<p>'It is all over!' he said. 'I am falling. Lord receive my
spirit.'</p>

<p>He clung desperately to the rope, closed his eyes, and
murmured:&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>Ave Maria, piena di grazia.</i>'</p>

<p>Then he felt more at ease. From above swept a breath of
cool wind; he recovered himself, collected his strength and
climbed higher, listening no longer to the humming of earth,
but ascending towards the serene and quiet heaven, saying
with great unction:&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>Ave, dolce Maria, di grazia piena.</i>'</p>

<p>At this moment, traversing the broad marble roof, came
the members of the building committee, Council of the
Fabric, architects both native and foreign, summoned by the
duke to consult about the Tiburio, the principal tower, which
was to rise even higher than the cupola. Among them was
Leonardo da Vinci; he had submitted his plan, but the
council had rejected it as too daring, too extravagant, and not
sufficiently in accord with the traditions of church architecture.
The council quarrelled over the matter, and could not
arrive at an agreement. Some said the building had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
commenced by ignorant people, and that the inner columns
were not stable enough to carry the Tiburio and all the lesser
towers and pinnacles. According to others the cathedral was
like to stand firm till Doomsday.</p>

<p>Leonardo took no part in the dispute, but stood aside,
silent and alone. One of the workmen approached and
handed him a letter.</p>

<p>'Messere,' he said, 'it has been brought to Your Magnificence
by a messenger from Pavia.'</p>

<p>Leonardo read the letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Leonardo, I need thee. Come to me at once. October 14.<br />
<span class="smcap i10">Gian Galeazzo</span>, the Duke.'</p>

<p>The Master excused himself to his fellow-councillors,
descended to the square, mounted, and rode off to the Castle
of Pavia, a few hours' distant from Milan.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>V</h3>

<p>In the great park the chestnuts, elms, and maples glowed
golden and purple under an autumn sun. Slowly, like dead
butterflies, the leaves dropped from the branches. There
was no bubbling of water in the grass-grown fountains.
Asters were withering in neglected flower-beds.</p>

<p>Approaching the castle Leonardo saw a dwarf; it was
Gian Galeazzo's old jester, the only servant who had
remained faithful to the dying duke. Recognising the
painter, he advanced running and leaping.</p>

<p>'How is His Highness?' asked Leonardo.</p>

<p>The dwarf made no reply, only waved his hands with a
gesture of despair; Leonardo directed his horse to the principal
entrance, but the other stopped him.</p>

<p>'Nay, not by this road,' said he, 'it hath too many eyes.
His Highness prays you to come secretly, for Madonna
Isabella would forbid your entry did she know of it. Come
by this path.'</p>

<p>They entered by a corner tower, then mounted a stair and
traversed apartments once magnificent but now gloomy and
deserted. The gilded Cordovan leather had been torn from
the walls; the throne and its silken canopy was hung with
cobwebs; autumn winds had blown yellow leaves through the
broken window panes.</p>

<p>'Thieves! ruffians!' muttered the dwarf, pointing out to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
his companion these marks of desolation. 'Believe me,
Messere, eyes cannot bear to look on the things done here.
I would have fled to the uttermost ends of the earth were it
not that my lord hath no one to look to but me, his ancient
deformity. This way, I pray you, this way.'</p>

<p>Opening a door he introduced Leonardo into a close dark
room, heavy with the odour of drugs.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>At that moment Gian Galeazzo was being bled: according
to the rules of surgery the operation was performed by
candle-light, and with closed shutters. The surgeon, or rather
the barber, a timid old man, was opening the vein, and his
assistant held the brass basin; the physician, a man of grave
and impenetrable countenance, wearing spectacles and a hood
of dark purple velvet and squirrel's fur, merely watched, for
to handle surgical instruments was derogatory to the dignity
of a Doctor of Medicine.</p>

<p>'Before night he shall be bled again,' said the great man
when the arm had been bandaged and the duke was restored
to his pillows.</p>

<p>'<i>Domine magister</i>,' objected the barber respectfully, 'were
it not wiser to wait? The patient is weakened, and an
excessive drain of blood&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>But he stopped short, for the doctor looked at him with
freezing irony.</p>

<p>''Tis time you knew that of the twenty-four pounds of blood
in the human body you may let twenty without damage. I
have bled sucking babes and seen them recover.'</p>

<p>Leonardo listened to this conversation, but reminded himself
that to dispute with doctors was vain as to argue with
alchemists. He held his peace till the empirics had departed
and the dwarf had covered the patient and shaken his pillows.
Above the bed hung a little green parrot in a cage; cards and
dice strewed the table. On it was also a glass with gold-fish,
at the duke's feet slept a little white dog,&mdash;all the faithful
servant's last attempts at ministering to his master's amusement.</p>

<p>'Has the letter been sent?' asked the sick man, not opening
his eyes.</p>

<p>'Excellency, Messer Leonardo has come. We waited,
fearing to disturb your Grace's slumber.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
A feeble smile illuminated the duke's countenance. He
tried to raise himself.</p>

<p>'Master, at last! And I had been fearing you would not
come!'</p>

<p>Gian Galeazzo took the artist's hand in his, and a faint
colour spread over his beautiful young face:&mdash;he was but four-and-twenty.
The dwarf left the room to keep guard at the
door.</p>

<p>'Friend,' began the duke, 'you have heard the slander?'</p>

<p>'Which slander, my lord?' asked the painter.</p>

<p>'If you know not which, 'tis that you have heard nothing,
and it is not worth the trouble of telling you. Yet no, I will
tell you, that we may have our mock at it together. They
say&mdash;&mdash;' He paused, looked the artist full in the eyes, and,
smiling calmly, completed the phrase; 'they say 'tis you have
murdered me.'</p>

<p>Leonardo thought him delirious, but he repeated:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Just that. They say 'tis you have murdered me. Three
weeks ago Il Moro and his Beatrice sent me a basket of
delectable peaches. But Madonna Isabella says that from
the moment I tasted them I have pined away; that in your
garden you have a peach-tree which bears poison.'</p>

<p>'In very truth,' assented Leonardo, 'I have such a tree.'</p>

<p>'<i>Amico mio!</i> can it be possible&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Nay; not if the fruit be really that from my garden. I can
explain the reason of these rumours. To study the effect of
poison upon trees, I inoculated my peach-tree with arsenic,
and warned Zoroastro, my disciple, to beware of the fruit.
Probably he was over hasty in relating the fact, for as matter
of truth the experiment failed and the peaches have proved
innocuous.'</p>

<p>'I knew it! I knew it!' cried the duke with relief. 'No
one is guilty of my death. Yet here each one is suspecting
the other, and hating and fearing him! If it were but
possible to speak openly, as you and I speak to each other
at this instant! My uncle is suspected of the deed; but I
know him to be a kindly man, though timorous and weak.
What interest could he have in my death when I myself
am willing to give him my throne? I want nothing; I
would gladly have left all these people and lived in retirement
and liberty with a few chosen friends. I would have
been a monk, or thy pupil, Leonardo. But no one will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
believe that I do not desire power. Why have they done this
evil? <i>Dio mio!</i> they have not poisoned me, but they have
poisoned themselves, poor blind ones! with the harmless
fruit of thy harmless tree. I have grieved over perverse fate
which makes me to die young, but now I am calm, I am at
ease, Master, as though on a scorching day I had thrown off
dusty clothes and cast myself into pure water. I know not
how to tell thee, dear friend, but of a surety thou dost comprehend,
thou who art thyself&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Leonardo smiled serenely, and pressed the poor wasted
hand, but did not answer.</p>

<p>'I knew that you would understand,' continued the invalid
with animation. 'Do you remember how once you said
to me that the study of those eternal laws which govern
the vicissitudes of nature conducts men to humility and to
great tranquillity of soul? Your phrase struck me even then;
but now in sickness, in loneliness&mdash;ay, in delirium&mdash;how often
do I remember thy words, and thyself, and thy countenance,
and thy voice, O Master! Sometimes it seems to me that by
different ways thou and I have reached the same end: thou
by the way of life&mdash;I by death.'</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened, and the dwarf burst into
the room, and announced with agitation:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Monna Druda!'</p>

<p>Leonardo would have retired, but the duke detained him,
and Gian Galeazzo's old nurse came in bearing a phial of
scorpion ointment. It was a precious balsam, made by
catching scorpions in the height of summer, when the sun is
in Cancer, keeping them for fifty days exposed to the sun,
then plunging them alive into hundred-year-old olive oil,
mixed with groundsel, mithridates, and snake-root. Nightly
the patient must be anointed at the temples, in the armpits,
on the belly, round the heart; and then the wise woman
swore he would take no ill from spells, from witchcraft, nor
eke from poison.</p>

<p>The old nurse, seeing Leonardo seated on the bed, stopped,
turned ashy-white, and came nigh dropping her priceless
balm.</p>

<p>'<i>Santa Vergine benedetta!</i> Defend us!' she murmured.
And crossing herself, and mumbling exorcisms and prayers,
she ran as fast as her old legs would carry her, to bring
Madonna Isabella the terrible tidings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Monna Druda was entirely convinced that Ludovico the
assassin, and Leonardo his accomplice, had brought Gian
Galeazzo to his death, if not by poison, at any rate by
witchcraft and the evil eye. The duchess Isabella, kneeling
in her private chapel before the most sacred image, was
praying fervently, when Monna Druda, greatly agitated,
rushed in to tell her Leonardo was with the duke. The
lady leaped to her feet, and cried, her face scarlet with
indignation:&mdash;</p>

<p>'It cannot be! Who has allowed him to pass?'</p>

<p>'Nay, Most Illustrious, who can tell how this accursed
sorcerer should pass? Have I not been saying to your
Excellency&mdash;&mdash;' She was interrupted by a page, who knelt
before the lady.</p>

<p>'Most Excellent Madonna, will your ladyship and your
ladyship's most illustrious consort deign to receive His
Majesty the Most Christian King of France?'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Charles <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span> was lodged in the lower floor of the Castle
of Pavia, luxuriously prepared for him by Ludovico Il Moro.
Reposing after his dinner, he was listening to the reading of
a book, absurdly translated out of the Latin into French, and
called <i>Mirabilia urbis Romæ</i>.</p>

<p>Charles had been a solitary, sickly child, frightened to
death by his father. During many weary years, in the Castle
of Amboise, he had beguiled his melancholy by the reading
of chivalric romances, till his brain, never of the strongest,
was completely turned. At twenty years of age he was on
the throne; and, his mind full of Lancelot, Tristram, and the
other heroes of the Round Table, believed himself destined
to rival these legendary persons, and to put into the reality of
life what belonged only to books and to dream. The court
poets bathed him in an atmosphere of perpetual adulation,
calling him the offspring of Mars, the heir of Julius Cæsar,
when at the head of a great host he had crossed the Alps,
and made his descent into Lombardy, lured by the extravagant
hope of conquering Italy and the East, and destroying the
heretical Mahometan religion.</p>

<p>To-night, listening to the description of the wonders of
Rome, the King smiled, thinking of the glory to accrue to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
him from the Eternal City. His thoughts were, however,
somewhat confused. He had dined heavily, and was now
troubled by stomach-ache and headache, and above all by
the recollection of a certain Madonna Lucrezia Crivelli,
whose beauty had haunted him for a day and a night.</p>

<p>Charles <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span> was low in stature and sufficiently ugly. His
chest was narrow, his shoulders crooked, his legs thin as a
pair of tongs. His nose was too large, his mouth hung open,
his projecting eyes were so short-sighted as to give him a
perpetually strained expression; his light hair was scanty, and
he had no moustache; his hands and face twitched convulsively,
his speech was thick and abrupt, it was said he had
six toes, and for this reason had set the court fashion
of broad soft shoes of black velvet, rounded at the top to the
form of a horse-shoe. This general ungainliness, together
with his habitual melancholy and distraction, produced an
impression not too ill warranted of natural imbecility.</p>

<p>'Thibaut! Thibaut!' he cried suddenly to his valet,
interrupting the reading with his customary abruptness, and
stammering with the effort to find his words. 'Thibaut!
I&mdash;somehow think I am thirsty. Eh? Perhaps the heat&mdash;&mdash;Bring
me some wine&mdash;Thibaut&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The Cardinal Brissonet, entering, announced that the duke
was expecting His Most Christian Majesty.</p>

<p>'Eh&mdash;eh? What? The duke? Good; we come immediately.
Let me first drink&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>And he stretched his hand for the cup brought by his
servant. Brissonet, however, stopped him, and demanded of
Thibaut:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Is it of our own?'</p>

<p>'No, Monsignore; from the ducal cellar. Our own is
consumed.'</p>

<p>Brissonet upset the cup.</p>

<p>'Your Majesty will pardon me, but the wines of this place
may be unwholesome. Thibaut, send a messenger at once to
the camp, and let him fetch a barrel from the field cellar.'</p>

<p>'Why&mdash;eh? What is this?' asked the King disconcerted.</p>

<p>The cardinal whispered that he feared poison; anything
might be expected from men who had done to death their
legitimate sovereign; true, nothing suspicious had yet occurred,
but prudence never comes amiss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
'Eh? All child's folly!' grumbled Charles, twitching one
shoulder: however, he submitted.</p>

<p>The heralds took their places before the king; pages
raised over his head the splendid baldachin of blue silk,
embroidered with the silver lilies of France; the seneschal
threw on his shoulders a scarlet mantle, ermine-bordered,
and embroidered with golden bees, and the motto, '<i>Roi des
abeilles n'a pas d'aiguillons</i>'; the procession traversed gloomy
and deserted halls, and took its way to the apartments of the
dying man.</p>

<p>Passing the chapel, the king caught sight of the Duchess
Isabella at her faldstool. He gallantly removed his cap,
stopped, and calling her 'dear sister,' would have kissed her
on the lips, according to the French ceremonial, but the
duchess hurried to throw herself at his feet.</p>

<p>'Have compassion on us, most clement lord,' she began
hurriedly, in set words. 'Defend the innocent, O magnanimous
knight-errant, and God shall give thee thy reward! Il
Moro has robbed us of everything; he has usurped our
throne; has given poison to Gian Galeazzo, my husband,
legitimate inheritor of the Lords of Milan! In our own
house he has surrounded us with spies and assassins....'</p>

<p>Charles scarcely understood or even listened.</p>

<p>'Eh? Eh? What?' he asked, stammering and twitching.
'No, no, sister. No occasion.... Rise, rise, I beseech
you.'</p>

<p>But the unhappy lady knelt on, embracing his knees,
weeping, and covering his hands with kisses.</p>

<p>'Ah, Sire, if you also fail me, what remains to me but to
take my life?'</p>

<p>This completed the king's embarrassment; puckering his
face like a child about to cry, he stuttered:&mdash;</p>

<p>'There, there! Good God! 'tis impossible! Brissonet!
Brissonet!&mdash;I can't. You tell her that&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Before this lady, who in her humility and her desperation
appeared to him sublime as some heroine of antique tragedy,
he felt no sentiment of compassion, but only an inane desire
to make his escape.</p>

<p>'Most noble lady, calm yourself,' said the cardinal, coldly
courteous. 'His Majesty will do all that is in his power
for you and for your consort, Messer Jean Galeas.' (So he
Gallicised the name.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
The duchess looked at the cardinal; then looked at the
king; and as if realising for the first time the sort of being
to whom she was making supplication, became silent.</p>

<p>Deformed, pitiful, ridiculous, he stood before her, his
mouth gaping, a foolish smile over his whole countenance,
his light eyes opened in a senseless stare.</p>

<p>'I, the grand-daughter of Ferdinand of Aragon, at the feet
of this abortion!&mdash;this idiot!'</p>

<p>She rose, and a flush mounted on her pale cheek.</p>

<p>The king felt it incumbent on him to say something, to
end somehow this embarrassing silence. He made a great
effort, shrugged his shoulders, blinked, but could get no
further than his usual&mdash;</p>

<p>'Eh? eh? What?' Then he waved his hand in despair,
and relapsed into dumbness. Isabella measured him with her
eyes in undissembled scorn, and Charles was abashed and
hung his head.</p>

<p>'Brissonet! Brissonet! Let us go! Eh? What?'</p>

<p>The pages threw open the doors, and his progress continued
till he had reached the room where Gian Galeazzo
lay dying. Here the shutters had been thrown back, and
the calm light of the autumn evening fell across the gilded
tree-tops and streamed in through the windows.</p>

<p>The king approached the sufferer, and inquired solicitously
after his health, calling him '<i>cousin</i>,' '<i>mon cousin</i>.' Gian
Galeazzo answered with such a gentle smile that the poor
king was relieved, and gradually recovered from his
confusion.</p>

<p>'May the Lord send victory to the hosts of your Highness,'
said the duke. 'And when you shall be at Jerusalem, at the
Holy Sepulchre of Christ, oh, then, pray for the health of my
poor soul; for by that time, sire, I&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, no! no, brother! Speak not thus,' protested Charles,
'you shall recover. We must march together against these
unclean Turks. Eh? Believe my words. I give you my
word&mdash;Eh? what?'</p>

<p>Gian Galeazzo shook his head.</p>

<p>'Impossible,' he murmured, looking into the king's eyes
with his penetrating glance. 'And, sire, when I shall be
dead, I pray you, abandon not my little Francesco and my
unhappy Isabella. They will have none other to look to.'</p>

<p>'Good God! Good God!' murmured Charles, overcome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
by unlooked-for emotion. His lips quivered, their corners
drooped, and, as by a sudden light from within, his face
shone with an immense kindliness. He bent over the sick
man and folded him in his arms.</p>

<p>'Brother! my poor dear brother!' They smiled sadly,
like a pair of poor sick children; and kissed each other.</p>

<p>When he had left the room, the king turned to the
cardinal.</p>

<p>'Brissonet&mdash;Brissonet! We must do something&mdash;eh?
Defend&mdash;protect&mdash;&mdash;This will not do! It cannot be permitted.
I am a knight; I must succour the unfortunate.
Do you understand?'</p>

<p>'Sire,' replied the cardinal, 'what is the use? His destiny
is to die. We cannot profit him, but we can damn ourselves.
Moreover, 'tis Il Moro who is your ally.'</p>

<p>'Il Moro is a murderer! that is it; a proper murderer,'
exclaimed Charles, his eyes sparkling with indignation.</p>

<p>'Is it our business?' asked Brissonet, shrugging his
shoulders, with a smile. 'Il Moro is neither better nor worse
than others. 'Tis political necessity. We are but men,
sire.'</p>

<p>The cup-bearer now came with a goblet of French wine,
which Charles drank thirstily. It refreshed him, and scattered
his sad thoughts. With the cup-bearer had entered a messenger
from Ludovico, bearing an invitation to supper for
the king. Charles declined it: the envoy pressed his suit,
but unavailingly. Then the messenger whispered to Thibaut,
who in turn whispered to the king.</p>

<p>'Your Highness&mdash;Madonna Lucrezia&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Eh? what? What Lucrezia?'</p>

<p>'The lady with whom your Majesty danced last night.'</p>

<p>'Ah, yes; to be sure. I recall her. Madonna Lucrezia;
a pretty little mouthful! Do you hint she would be at supper?'</p>

<p>'Certes, she will be there. And she supplicates your
Highness&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'She supplicates? Eh? What say you, Thibaut? I,
forsooth&mdash;&mdash;Well, well, to-morrow we take the field&mdash;'tis
the last time. Messere, give your master my thanks, and
tell him that I&mdash;forsooth&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The King took Thibaut aside.</p>

<p>'Hark you&mdash;this Madonna Lucrezia&mdash;who is she?'</p>

<p>'Sire, the leman of Il Moro.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
'Alas!'</p>

<p>'A single word from your Majesty and all can be accompolished
this evening itself, if you will, sire.'</p>

<p>'No! no! How? I&mdash;his guest?'</p>

<p>'Il Moro will find his pleasure in it. Sire, you understand
not this people here!'</p>

<p>'Well then, well! As you will. It is your affair.'</p>

<p>'Your Majesty may be at ease. A single word&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Speak no more, Thibaut. It mislikes me. Have I not
said 'tis your work. I have nothing to say to it. Do what
you choose!'</p>

<p>Thibaut bowed and withdrew.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the foot of the stair the king frowned and
scratched his head, trying to recall his thoughts.</p>

<p>'Brissonet! Brissonet! What was I saying? Ah yes&mdash;to
defend&mdash;offended innocence. I am sworn knight&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Your Majesty must quit these thoughts. They fit not
with the present moment. Later, when we shall have
returned victorious from Jerusalem&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Jerusalem!' echoed the king, and his eyes dilated, and
on his lips came a pale, faint, dreamy smile.</p>

<p>'The hand of the Lord leads your Majesty to victory,' continued
Brissonet; 'the finger of God points the way to the
army of the cross.'</p>

<p>Charles raised his eyes to heaven as if inspired, and
repeated, 'Finger of God! Finger of God!'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The young duke died eight days later. Before his death
he prayed for an interview with Leonardo, but Isabella refused
to permit it, Monna Druda having told her that the bewitched
have always an insuperable and fatal wish to see those who
have enchanted them. The old woman indefatigably anointed
the patient with scorpion ointment, the doctor ordered bloodletting,
the barber opened veins. Nevertheless he quietly
died.</p>

<p>'Thy will be done,' were his last words.</p>

<p>Ludovico had his body taken from Pavia to Milan, and
buried him under the shadow of the cathedral.</p>

<p>Nobles and elders of the city assembled at the castle, and
Ludovico, after assuring them of the profound grief he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
suffered at the untimely death of his nephew, made proposal
that the child Francesco, Gian Galeazzo's son, should be
declared duke. The assembly maintained it were madness
to invest an infant with such power. Il Moro himself was
implored, in the name of the people, to assume the sceptre.
He feigned refusal, but reluctantly yielded to their prayers.</p>

<p>Gold brocade was brought, and the duke put it on; he
then rode to the basilica of Sant' Ambrogio surrounded by
a crowd of courtiers&mdash;<i>Viva il Moro! Viva il duca!</i>&mdash;amid
the sounding of trumpets, the firing of cannon, the clashing
of bells, and&mdash;the silence of the people.</p>

<p>A few days later the most sacred relic in Milan, one of the
nails of the True Cross, was solemnly transported to the
cathedral. By this function Il Moro hoped to please the
populace and to consolidate his power.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>That night a crowd assembled before Tibaldo's wine-cellar
in the Piazza dell' Arrengo. There were present the tinman
Scarabullo, Mascarello the goldsmith, Maso the furrier, Corbolo
the shoemaker, and Gorgoglio the glass-blower. Standing
on a cask in the middle of the crowd was Fra Timoteo,
the Domenican, delivering a sermon.</p>

<p>'Brothers! when Santa Elena had found the life-giving Tree
of the Cross and the other instruments of the Lord's Passion,
which had been buried by the heathen in the earth under the
shrine of Venus, then the Emperor Constantine, taking one
of these most holy and awful nails, bade the smiths work it
into the bit of his war-horse, that thus the word of the prophet
Zechariah might be fulfilled: "In that day shall there be
upon the bells of the horses Holiness unto the Lord." And
this ineffable relic gave him the victory over his enemies and
over the adversaries of the Roman Empire.' ... Here
Fra Timoteo made a pause, then raising his hands to heaven
he cried in a lamentable voice:&mdash;'And now, brethren beloved,
a great abomination is being committed. Il Moro, the evildoer,
the homicide, the usurper, seduceth the people with
impious festivals, and would use the most Holy Nail for the
support of his trembling throne.'</p>

<p>The crowd showed agitation, and low cries were heard.</p>

<p>'And know ye, my brethren, upon whom he hath devolved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
the construction of the machine for raising the Nail to its place
in the cupola above the high altar?'</p>

<p>'To whom?'</p>

<p>'To Leonardo da Vinci, the Florentine.'</p>

<p>'Who is this Leonardo?' asked several persons.</p>

<p>'Nay,' returned others, 'we know him; the poisoner of the
young duke!'</p>

<p>'Leonardo the sorcerer! Leonardo the heretic! the
infidel!'</p>

<p>Corbolo timidly undertook the defence.</p>

<p>'Friends, I have heard say that Leonardo is a good man,
who does ill to none, and is compassionate not only of men
but of the meanest animals.'</p>

<p>'Speak not foolishly, Corbolo!'</p>

<p>'Hold your tongue. How can a sorcerer be good?'</p>

<p>'My sons! my sons!' declaimed Fra Timoteo, 'there shall
be a day when men shall praise the great deceiver, him who
walketh in darkness, saying of him, "He is kind, he is just,
he is good"; for his face shall be like unto the face of the
Christ, and he shall have a voice comforting and pleasant
like the voice of a singing woman. And many shall be led
astray by his wily kindness. And by the four winds of heaven
he shall call together tribes and nations, as a partridge with
a deceiving cry calls into her nest the brood of another. Be
watchful, O brethren! Behold the angel of darkness, the
prince of this world, who is called Antichrist, cometh in
human shape. Be watchful, I say, because this Florentine,
this Leonardo, is the precursor and the servant of Antichrist.'</p>

<p>''Tis true!' cried Gorgoglio (who, however, had never
before even heard of Leonardo); 'they say he has sold his
soul to the devil, and has signed the covenant with his
blood.'</p>

<p>'Holy Mother of God, have mercy upon us!' babbled
Barbaccia the fruit-woman. 'Stamma, the wench at the
hangman's who does charing at the prison, told me that this
Leonardo (Heaven defend me from speaking his name after
dusk) wrests the bodies from the gallows&mdash;cuts them up&mdash;takes
out their bowels&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You know not what you speak,' said Corbolo; ''tis a
matter of science, and called Anatomy.'</p>

<p>'They say he has made a contrivance to fly in the air on
bird's wings,' observed Mascarello the goldsmith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
'Veglias also, that old winged serpent, rebelled against
God,' commented Fra Timoteo; 'Simon Magus also raised
himself into the air for flight, but the holy Apostle Saint Paul
threw him down.'</p>

<p>'He walketh on the water,' cried Scarabullo. 'He says,
"God walked on the sea and so will I." Heard you ever so
great blasphemy?'</p>

<p>'He goes into a bell, and descends to the bottom of the
deep,' added Maso.</p>

<p>'Nay, brothers, credit not that!' cried Gorgoglio. 'What
need hath he of a bell? He transforms himself into a
fish and swims; he transforms himself into a bird and doth
fly.'</p>

<p>'<i>Ahi!</i> beloved brothers!' cried Timoteo; 'and the nail,
the Holy Nail is in the hands of this Leonardo!'</p>

<p>'It shall not be!' shouted Scarabullo, clenching his fists;
death to us sooner than profanation of our holy things! We
will tear the Nail from the hands of the infidel.'</p>

<p>'Vengeance for the Holy Nail! Vengeance for our
poisoned lord! Burn him! Hang him!'</p>

<p>'Brothers, what do ye?' cried the shoemaker with imploring
hands; 'the night patrol will pass in a moment, and the
captain of justice&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'To the devil with the captain of justice! Run if you're
frightened, Corbolo; run under your wife's petticoat.'</p>

<p>And armed with cudgels, staves, poles, and stones, the
crowd surged through the streets, shouting and cursing. In
front went the monk, bearing the crucifix and chanting the
psalm, 'Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered! As wax
melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence
of God!'</p>

<p>The torches smoked and flared. In their scarlet light the
lonely moon grew pale, and the quiet stars trembled in the
heavens.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>X</h3>

<p>Leonardo in his quiet workshop was occupied with the
machine for the elevation of the Holy Nail. Zoroastro was
making a casket, all glass and gold, in which the relic was to
be displayed. Giovanni Boltraffio was sitting in a dark
corner watching the Master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Gradually, however, Leonardo had forgotten his machine,
his thoughts having wandered to theories as to the transmission
of force by means of blocks and levers. He had made
a complicated calculation in which the mathematical law (the
inner principle of reason) had explained to him the
mechanical law (the outer principle of nature); two great
secrets were thus fused into one still greater secret.</p>

<p>'Man,' thought he, 'will never invent anything so perfect,
as doth Nature, which of necessity so disposeth her laws that
every effect is straitly bound up with its cause.'</p>

<p>In face of the infinite abyss into which he was directing his
penetrating gaze, his soul was filled with that sense of overwhelming
wonder which has no likeness to the other sentiments
of men. On the margin of the paper, covered with the
calculations for the simple machinery required for the elevation
of the Holy Nail, he wrote these words which echoed in
his heart like a prayer:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>O mirabile giustizia di te, Primo Motore! tu non hai voluto
mancare a nessuna potenza l'ordine e qualità de suoi necessari
effetti!</i>' (O admirable justice of Thee, Prime Mover!
To no force hast Thou permitted lack of the order and
quality of its necessary effects!)</p>

<p>But the artist's meditations were interrupted by a furious
knocking at the outer door, together with chanting of psalms,
and the objurgations and yells of an inflamed rabble.
Giovanni and Zoroastro were rushing to see what had happened,
when Maturina the cook, with dishevelled hair, burst
half dressed into the room, crying:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Thieves! Robbers! Murderers! Holy Mother of God
have mercy on us!'</p>

<p>'What is it?' asked Leonardo of Marco d'Oggionno, who
had also entered, arquebus in hand, and was beginning to
shut the shutters.</p>

<p>'I know not exactly. It would seem a crowd of housebreakers,
egged on by monks.'</p>

<p>'What is their demand?'</p>

<p>'Only their father can understand these sons of the devil!
They demand the Holy Nail.'</p>

<p>'I have it not. 'Tis in the sacristy in the care of Monsignor
Arcimboldi.'</p>

<p>''Tis what I told them. But being mad as dogs in the time
of the summer solstice, they hearkened not, but continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
to vilify Your Worship as an infidel and a sorcerer, and the
poisoner of Gian Galeazzo.'</p>

<p>During this colloquy the noise in the street grew apace.</p>

<p>'Open, or we will fire this accursed nest. In one moment,
Leonardo, you shall be flayed! Demon! Antichrist!'</p>

<p>'Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered!' chanted Fra
Timoteo to the accompaniment of Farfanicchio's stridulous
whistle.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jacopo, the wicked little servant, ran in, sprang
on the window ledge, opened the shutter, and was going to
jump into the courtyard, but Leonardo held him back.</p>

<p>'Whither art going, child?'</p>

<p>'To call the guard. The captain of justice passes at this
hour.'</p>

<p>'No, no. If they catch you they will kill you without a
word spoken.'</p>

<p>'They shall not see me. I will get over the wall, through
Aunt Trulla's garden, over the green ditch into the backyard.
'Tis as good as done! Likewise it were better they killed me
than you, Master.'</p>

<p>And glancing back with eyes full of love and daring, the
lad leaped from the window, and was off like a flash.</p>

<p>'For once the little devil is some use,' said Maturina shaking
her head.</p>

<p>A stone came crashing through the window, and shrieking
and wringing her hands, the fat woman fled, felt her way
down the dark stairs to the cellar, and hid in a wine-cask.
Marco hurried upstairs to bar the windows; Giovanni, pale,
distressed, but indifferent to the peril, turned a woeful
countenance to Leonardo, and fell at his feet.</p>

<p>'O Master, they say&mdash;&mdash;I swear it is not true&mdash;nay, I
believe it not&mdash;but for God's sake tell me yourself&mdash;&mdash;!' and
he stopped short, panting with agitation. Leonardo smiled
sadly.</p>

<p>'You fear they speak truth that I am a murderer?'</p>

<p>'A word, master! a single word from your own lips!'</p>

<p>'But why, friend? If you can harbour a doubt, you would
not believe me.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Messer Leonardo, I am in torture ... A word, a
single word!'</p>

<p>Leonardo did not answer immediately; then he said in a
shaking voice:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
'You also, Giovanni, with them! You, also, against me!'</p>

<p>Outside the blows were such that the whole house shook.
Scarabullo was forcing the door with an axe. Leonardo,
hearing the imprecations and the insults of the infuriated
crowd, felt his heart contracted with anguish and great solitude.
His chin drooped, and his glance fell on the lines
just written: '<i>O mirabile giustizia di te, Primo Motore!</i>'</p>

<p>He smiled, and with great humility repeated the words of
the dying Gian Galeazzo:&mdash;</p>

<p>'All is well. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.'</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Giovanni's Diary</span></p>

<p>On the 25th of March 1494 I entered myself as a disciple
in the studio of Messer Leonardo da Vinci, the Florentine
master.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is the order of his teaching:&mdash;perspective; the
dimensions and proportions of the human body; drawings
from examples by the best masters; drawings from nature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To-day Marco d'Oggionno, my fellow-disciple, has given
me a book, taken down entirely from the words of our Master.
The book begins thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The purest joy is given to the body by the light of the
sun; to the spirit, by the clear shining of mathematics.
That is why the science of Perspective (in which the contemplation
of the bright line&mdash;<i>la linia radiosa</i>&mdash;true solace of the
eye, goes hand in hand with the clearness of mathematics&mdash;true
solace of the mind) must be exalted above all other
human research and science. May He who said, "I am
the true Light," lend me His aid that I may know the science
of Perspective&mdash;the science of His light. I divide this book
into three parts: the first, the diminishing, by distance, of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
<i>size of objects</i>; the second, the diminishing of the <i>distinctness
of the colour</i>; the third, the diminishing of the <i>clearness of the
outline</i>.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Master cares for me like a father. When he learned
of my poverty, he refused to take the monthly payment
agreed on.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Master says:&mdash;</p>

<p>'When you shall have grasped well your Perspective, and
hold in your mind the proportions of the human body, then
in your walks abroad notice assiduously the postures and
movements of men, how they stand, walk, talk, and quarrel;
how they laugh and fight; the manner of their faces when
they are doing these things, and the manner of the faces of
the bystanders who want to separate the fighters; and the
faces of those who look on with apathy. Set all in pencil
in a note-book of coloured paper, which you should always have
about you. When the booklet is filled, take another; put the
first one away and keep it. In no wise destroy nor rub out
these sketches; for the movements of the body are so endless
that no memory could hold them all. That is why you must
look on these rough sketches as your best teachers.'</p>

<p>I have made myself such a sketch-book.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To-day in the Vicolo dei Pattari, not far from the cathedral,
I encountered my uncle, Oswald Ingrim. He told me he
renounced me; and accused me of ruining my soul in the
house of the heretic and the infidel.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whenever I am heavy of heart, I have but to look on his
face to grow light and gay. How wondrous are his eyes;
clear, blue, pale, and cold&mdash;cold as ice. The voice, most
pleasant and soft. The most cruel, the most obdurate, can
by no means resist his persuasiveness. He sits at his work-table,
immersed in thoughts, parting and smoothing his
golden beard, long and soft as the silk of a maiden. When
he talks with any one, then he partly closes one eye with
a merry and kind expression; his glance from under the thick
and overhanging eyebrows penetrates the very soul.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He dislikes lively colours, and new and discommoding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
fashions; nor does he affect perfumes. His linen is of
Rhenish stuff, marvellous clean and fine. His black velvet
<i>berretto</i> carries no plumes nor ornaments. His suiting is
of black; but he wears a mantle of dark red which reaches
to the knee, and hangs in straight folds, as was the old
mode in Florence. His movements are easy and quiet,
but notable. He is like no one else.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shoots excellently with the bow or arbalist, rides, swims,
is a master of fence with the small sword. To-day I saw
him hit the highest point of the cupola of a church with
a small thrown coin. Messer Leonardo, by the skill and the
strength of his hand, surpassed every competitor.</p>

<p>He is left-handed; but with that same left hand, for all it
looks delicate and soft as a woman's, he bends iron fetters
and twists the tongue of a brazen bell.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While I was watching him, the child Jacopo ran in laughing
and clapping his hands.</p>

<p>'Cripples, Messer Leonardo, monsters! Come your ways
into the kitchen, I have brought you such beauties that you
shall lick your fingers for joy!'</p>

<p>'Whence came they?'</p>

<p>'From the porch of Sant' Ambrogio. Beggars from
Bergamo! I promised you'd give them supper if they'd
let themselves be painted.'</p>

<p>Leaving the picture of the Virgin unfinished, Leonardo
betook him to the kitchen, I following. We found two
brothers, very old and swollen with dropsy, great hanging
<i>goîtres</i> on their throats. With them was the wife of one of
them, a withered little old body, whose name Ragnina (little
spider) seemed very suitable.</p>

<p>'You see,' cried Jacopo triumphantly, 'I said you would be
pleased! Don't I know exactly what you like?'</p>

<p>Leonardo sat down by the hobgoblin cripples, ordered wine
to be brought, served it to them himself, questioned them
kindly, told them absurd stories to make them laugh. At first
they were restive and suspicious, not understanding why they
had been brought in. But when he related an anecdote about
a dead Jew, whom his compatriots, to evade the law forbidding
the burial of Hebrews within the confines of Bologna, had
cut in pieces, pickled, spiced, and sent to Venice where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
he was eaten by a Florentine Christian, the Little Spider
was like to burst with laughter. Soon all three were tipsy,
and laughing and talking and making the most horrible faces.
I was disgusted and looked away; but Leonardo watched
them with deep and eager curiosity; and when their hideousness
had reached its height, took out his sketch-book and
drew with the same delighted attention that he had lavished
on the smile of the Virgin.</p>

<p>In the evening he showed me a whole collection of caricatures;
grotesques not only of men but also of beasts&mdash;terrible
shapes, like those which haunt sick men in their delirium,
the human and the bestial compounded to make one
shudder. The muzzle of a porcupine, its quills bristling,
its under lip pendent, loose, and thin as a rag, displaying
in a human grin two long white teeth like almonds; an old
woman, her nose spread and hairy, and scarce bigger than
a mole, her lips monstrously thick, like those squat and viscid
fungi which grow out of withered trunks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cesare da Sesto tells me that sometimes the Master, having
met some monstrosity in the street, will follow it for a
whole day. Great deformity, he says, is as rare as great
beauty; only mediocrity is negligible.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Marco d'Oggionno works like an ox, and carries out all the
teacher's rules; the more he tries the less is his success.
He is endowed with an invincible constancy. He thinks
patience and labour shall possess all things; nor doth he
despair of some day becoming a great painter.</p>

<p>He takes also, more than any of us, rare delight in the
master's inventions. One of these days he carried his note-book
to the Piazza del Broletto, and according to the Master's
system he made the required indexed notes of those faces
which struck him chiefly in the crowd. But on reaching
home he could in no wise translate his notes into a living
face. Likewise did he fail in the use of Leonardo's spoon
for measuring out colour. His shadows remain thick and
unnatural, just as his faces are wooden and devoid of all
charm. Marco accounts for this by some small failure in his
obedience to the rules. Cesare da Sesto ridicules him.</p>

<p>'This most excellent Marco,' he says, 'is a martyr in
the cause of science. His example shows that all these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
measures and rules be worth nothing. To know how infants
are born does not suffice to beget one. Leonardo deceiveth
himself and others; he teaches one thing and performs
another. When he paints he follows no rule save that of
inspiration; yet he is not content to be a great artist, but
would be a man of science also. I fear lest, coursing two
hares, he run down neither.'</p>

<p>It may be that in this mockery of Cesare's there is a
modicum of truth; but no love for the Master. Leonardo
hearkens to him, praises his intelligence, and never is wroth
with him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am watching how he works at his <i>Cenacolo</i>. Betimes,
before sunrise, he goes to the convent refectory, and paints
till the shadows close in on him, nor does the brush fall
from his hands, nor does he remember food and drink.
Sometimes he lets whole weeks go by in which he touches
not his paints. Sometimes he will stand for two hours on the
scaffold before the picture examining it and criticising what
he has done. At other times I have known him rush forth
in the mid-day heat through the blazing streets, being drawn
by some viewless power to the monastery; he will mount his
scaffold, do two touches or mayhap three, and rush away at
once.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He is working at the countenance of the Apostle John.
To-day he should have completed it. Instead he remained
at home with the child Jacopo, watching the flight of hornets,
wasps, and flies. So absorbed is he in studying the construction
of their bodies that 'twould seem on it depended
the destiny of the human race. Having perceived that the
hind legs of flies serve them as a rudder, he experienced
greater pleasure than if he had found the secret of perpetual
felicity. He thinks the discovery useful, and like to serve
his apparatus for flight. Poor Apostle John!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To-day there is a new distraction, and the flies are
abandoned. The Master is working on a design, beautiful
and wondrous delicate, which is to form the coat-of-arms of
an academy not yet existing outside the brain of the duke.
The device is a square containing a crown of cords, geometrically
intertwined, in knots without beginning or end. I could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
not restrain myself, but reminded him of the unfinished
apostle. He shrugged his shoulders, and without raising his
eyes from the crown of cords, he said through his closed
teeth:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Patience! time enough! The head of John will not run
away!'</p>

<p>I begin to comprehend Cesare's malice!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The duke has entrusted to him the construction within the
palace of hearing-tubes concealed in the thickness of the
walls, after the fashion of the Ear of Dionysius. Leonardo
began with ardour, but now has cooled and catches at every
pretext for laying the work aside. The duke hurries him and
is wroth; this morning he summoned him several times to
the palace, but the Master is occupied with experiments on
vegetables. He has cut away the roots from a pumpkin,
leaving but one small shoot, which he assiduously drenches
with water. To his great joy the plant has not withered.
'The mother,'says he, 'nourishes well her children.' Sixty
little oblong pumpkins have formed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cesare says Leonardo is the greatest of the libertines.
He has written a hundred and twenty volumes on matters
of natural science, but all in fragments, in dispersed notes on
flying leaves; and he keeps a MS. of over five thousand pages
in such disorder that he himself cannot find anything in it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Coming into my little room, he said: 'Giovanni, have you
noticed that small rooms dispose the mind to profundity,
large ones to breadth? And have you observed how the
images of things, seen through the shadow of rain, are clearer
than in the sunlight?'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two days of work on the head of John the Apostle. But,
alas! something has been lost through flies, pumpkins, cats,
and the ear of Dionysius. He has again failed to complete
the head, and now, disgusted with his paint-box, retired into
geometry. He says that the odour of the paint nauseates
him, and the sight of the brushes. Thus the days pass; at
the caprice of chance, and submitting to the will of God, we,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
as it were, lie in port waiting for a wind. Fortunately he
has forgotten the flying-machine or we should starve.</p>

<p>What to others appears perfection is to him teeming with
error. He aims at the highest, at the unattainable, at what
is for ever beyond the reach of the hand of man. Therefore
his productions rest incomplete.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Andrea Salaino has fallen sick. The Master nurses him,
sits up at night, watches by his pillow; but no one dare speak
to him of medicine. Marco d'Oggionno surreptitiously introduced
a pill-box, but Leonardo found it, and cast it from
the window. Andrea himself desired to be bled, and spoke
of a most skilled phlebotomist of his acquaintance; but the
Master grew properly indignant, speaking of all doctors with
epithets most injurious.</p>

<p>'Heed rather to preserve than to cure your health; and
beware of physicians.' He added with a smile, good-natured
yet malicious, 'Every man scrapes up his money only to give
it to them, the destroyers of lives.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Master has taken in hand a treatise on painting; the
Lord knows when he will finish it. Latterly he has been
much busied (I likewise, helping him) with aerial and line
perspective, both in light and shade, and he has given me
discourses and fugitive thoughts upon art. I will now write
down such as I can remember of the noblest of sciences; and
may those into whose hands these pages shall fall, remember
in their prayers the soul of the great Florentine master,
Leonardo da Vinci, and the soul of Giovanni Boltraffio, his
humble disciple.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Master says 'All which is beautiful, even humanly
beautiful, dies, except in art. (<i>Cosa bella mortal passa e non
d'arte.</i>)</p>

<p>'He who despises painting despises the philosophical and
refined contemplation of the world. Painting is the grandchild
of Nature and the kinswoman of God.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'<i>Il pittore deve essere universale.</i> O painter, be thy variety
infinite as the phenomena of Nature! Carrying on what God
has begun, seek to multiply, not the works of men's hands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
but those of the eternal hands of God. Imitate no one; let
thy every work be a new phenomenon of Nature.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'For him who is master of the fundamental natural laws;
for him who <i>knows</i>, it is easy to be universal; because all
bodies, whether of men or of beasts, are really formed on the
same principles.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Take heed lest in thee the greed for gold suffocate the love
of art; and remember that the conquest of glory excels the
glory of conquest. The memory of the rich perishes with
them, the memory of the wise endures for ever; because
science and wisdom are the legitimate children of their
father, and money is but his bastard. Love glory, and be
not fearful of poverty. Consider how many philosophers
have laid down the wealth to which they were born, that
they might enrich their souls with virtue, and have lived
content in misery.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Knowledge rejuvenates the soul, and lightens the burden
of old age. Therefore gather wisdom, that thou mayest gather
sweets for thine age.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'There is a generation of painters who, to hide their meagre
knowledge, shelter themselves behind the beauty of gold and
azure, and say they give not of their best because of the
scanty payment they receive, and that they could surpass
any man were they as well rewarded as he. O fools! what
hinders them to make something beautiful, and to say,
"This picture is such a price, and this other is less, and this,
third least of all; showing that they have work for every
price?"'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Not infrequently the lust for gold brings even the good
masters down to the level of craftsmen. Thus my countryman
and comrade, Perugino the Florentine, arrived at such
rapidity of execution, that once he replied to his wife, who
called him to dinner, "Serve the soup while I paint one more
saint!"'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'The artist who has no mistrust of himself will never attain
to the supreme heights of art. Well for thee if thy work be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
higher, ill for thee if it equal, woe to thee if it fall below,
thine own estimation! Pitiful is that artificer who, persuaded
that he has produced a masterpiece, questions wonderingly
how God can have helped him to such purpose.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Listen with long suffering to the criticisms which men pass
on your picture; and weigh their words to see if, perchance,
they, faulting it, be in the right. If they be right, correct;
if they be wrong, feign deafness; or if they be persons worthy
of notice, show them their error. The judgment of an enemy
is often nearer the truth than the judgment of a friend; hatred is
often profounder than love. The intellect of him who hates,
sees and penetrates better than the intellect of him who loves.
A true friend is like thyself; but an enemy resembles thee
not, and in this is his strength. Hatred throws light.
Remember this, and despise not the criticisms of thine
enemy.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Bright colours captivate the vulgar, but the true artist seeks
not to please the vulgar, but the elect. His pride and his
aim is not in the dazzling by colour, but in the performance
of a miracle, namely, that by the play of light and shadow,
things which are flat should appear round. He who neglecting
the shadows, sacrifices them to the splendour of tinting, is
like the vain babbler who sacrifices significance for sounding
and furious words.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Above all, beware of coarse, sharp outlines. The shadows
on a young and delicate body should be neither dead nor
stony, but light, evasive, and transparent like air; for the
human body is itself transparent, as you can convince yourself
by looking through your fingers at the sun. Too brilliant
a light gives not good shadows; wherefore be wary of it.
Observe the tenderness and charm on the faces of men and
women as they pass along the shadowed street between the
dark walls of the houses under twilight on clouded days.
This is the most perfect light; your shadow, gradually
vanishing into the light, will fade like smoke&mdash;like a soft
music. Remember that between the light and the dark
there is something which participates in both; a bright
shadow or a dark light. Seek for it, O painter! for therein
lies the secret of captivation&mdash;of charm.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
These words he spoke, and raising his hands as if wishing
to imprint the lesson on our memories, he repeated, with
indescribable emphasis, 'Reject coarse and heavy outlines;
confound your shadows in the light, letting them vanish little
by little, like smoke; like a tender music.'</p>

<p>Cesare, who was listening attentively, raised his eyes and
smiled, as if about to dispute; nevertheless he remained
silent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Later, speaking on another topic, Leonardo said:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Falsehood is so shameful that even in praising God it
dishonours Him. Truth is so excellent that in speaking of
the vile it ennobles. Between truth and falsehood there is a
difference no less than between light and darkness.'</p>

<p>Here Cesare, suddenly struck by an idea, fixed scrutinising
eyes on the Master.</p>

<p>'How?' he said. 'Yet, Master, have you not told us that
between the darkness and the light there exists an intermediary,
something which participates in both, and is, as it
were, bright shadow and dark light. Then, between truth
and lie&mdash;but no, 'tis absurd. Master, your metaphor lands
me in great temptation! For the painter who, you say, seeks
enslaving charm in the compounding of light and shadow,
may rightly seek also the twilight between true and false.'</p>

<p>At first Leonardo frowned, and seemed indignant that one
of his pupils should exhibit such an obsession; then he
replied smiling:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Tempt me not! Get thee behind me, Satan!'</p>

<p>I had expected a different answer; to my thinking, Cesare's
words merited better than an idle jest. In me, at any rate
they excited a tumult of strange and tormenting ideas.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To-night I beheld him, standing in the rain in a close and
fetid alley, absorbed in the contemplation of certain spots of
dampness on a stone. He stood there a long while, and the
urchins in the street nudged each other and mocked him. I
asked him what he beheld in the stone.</p>

<p>'Giovanni,' he said, 'see the splendid monstrous figure!
Chimera, with her jaws wide; and beside her an angel with
flying hair and airy flight, fleeing from the monster. The
caprice of chance has produced a picture worthy of a great
artist.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
He traced with his finger the outline of the damp spot,
and to my amazement I recognised that what he said was
true.</p>

<p>'Many,' he said, 'think this habit of mine an absurdity;
but experience has taught me how useful it is for the education
of the fancy. I have taken from such things what I
wanted, and brought them to completeness. Listen to far-off
bells; you can find in their confused clang the very names
and words you lack.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For tears the eyebrows contract; for laughter they expand.</p>

<p>The Master goes gladly with those condemned to death,
watching in their faces the degrees of their agony and terror;
and the very executioners wonder at him, when he makes
a study of the last quivering of the muscles.</p>

<p>'Nay, Giovanni, you understand not the man he is!'
cried Cesare. 'He will lift a worm from the path lest his foot
crush it; but if his own mother were a-dying he would watch
the contracting of her eyebrows, the wrinkling of her forehead,
the drooping of the corners of the mouth.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'Note the expression and the gestures of deaf-mutes.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'When you watch persons, do it without letting them know;
so shall their movements, their laughter, and their tears be
more natural.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'An artist whose own hands are angular and bony, is apt to
depict people with angular and bony hands; for every man
likes the faces and the bodies which resemble his own. The
ugly painter will choose ugly models, and <i>vice versâ</i>. Let not
the men and the women whom you paint seem your blood-brothers
either in beauty or in deformity. This is a fault
which attaches to many Italian artists. In painting there is
no error more treacherous. I consider the temptation arises
from the fact that the soul makes the body which belongs to
it. Of old it shaped and fashioned it in its own likeness;
and now when again it is called upon to fashion a new body
with brushes and paint, it yearns to reproduce the shape in
which it has long had its habitation.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
The Master tells us, ''Tis not experience, the mother of all
arts and sciences, which deceives men, but imagination, which
promises them what experience cannot give. Experience
is not to blame, but our own vain and senseless lusts.
Experience would have us aim at the possible, and not strive
ignorantly for what we can never obtain; lest we become the
prey of despair.'</p>

<p>When we were alone Cesare repeated these words, and
cried as in disgust:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Hypocrisy and lies!'</p>

<p>'How has he lied?' asked I.</p>

<p>'Not to aim at the impossible! not to follow the unattainable!
Well, it may be some one will believe his words, but
'twill not be I nor you! I have penetrated to his inmost
soul.'</p>

<p>'And what see you there, Cesare?'</p>

<p>'All his life through, he has done nothing but aim at
the impossible, nothing but follow the unattainable! What
else is he about in this machine to turn men into birds,
in that other to set them in water like fish? And the
chimerical monsters he finds in the spots on walls and
in the outline of the clouds; and the mystic charm of
divine faces seen in angelic visions&mdash;whence does he derive
all this? From experience? from his diagram of noses,
and his ladle for measuring out paint? Why does he deceive
himself? Why lie? His mechanical studies are for the
performance of a miracle; for raising himself into heaven
by flight, for using natural forces to do that which is against
Nature. He stretches out towards God or devil, he cares
not which, provided 'tis something unexampled, beyond
possibility. The less is his faith, the greater is his quenchless
curiosity.'</p>

<p>These words of Cesare's have filled my soul with anxiety.
For several days I have thought them over: I would fain
forget them, but I cannot.</p>

<p>To-day, however, the Master, as if in answer to my doubts,
has said to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>'A little knowledge puffs up; great knowledge makes
humble. Blasted ears raise proud heads; those full of grain
bow down.'</p>

<p>'Then,' asked Cesare with his accustomed ironic smile,
'how happed it that Lucifer, prince of the cherubim, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
renowned for wisdom, was moved by wisdom not to humility,
but to pride that cast him into hell?'</p>

<p>Leonardo did not answer at once; presently he told us
this fable.</p>

<p>'Once a drop of water aspired to reach the sky. Winged
by fire, it rose up in fine steam. But mounted on high it
met air still finer and very cold, and the fire deserted it.
Then it shivered and grew heavy, and, its presumption
changing into terror, fell as rain. And cast down from
heaven it fell upon the earth, and was drunk up by dryness;
and for long time it was shut up in prison underground,
and there did penance for its sin.'</p>

<p>He added no more, but I thought I understood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The longer I live with him the less I know him. To-day
he has again been playing like a child. And such strange
pranks! Before going to bed I was sitting in my chamber
reading my favourite book, <i>The Little Flowers of Saint
Francis</i>, when suddenly a cry rang through the house from
our old woman, the kind and faithful Maturina&mdash;</p>

<p>'Fire! Help! Help! Fire!'</p>

<p>I rushed out. An appallingly thick white smoke filled the
Master's studio. He was there himself, standing among
clouds like some ancient magi, and illumined by unearthly
blue flames. His face was merry, and he looked jovially
at the pale and terrified Maturina, and at Marco, who had
rushed in with two buckets of water, to empty over the
drawings and manuscripts strewing the table. Leonardo,
however, stopped him, saying it was all a jest. Smoke and
flames came from a heated brazier containing a powder of
frankincense and resin. I cannot say which took the greater
pleasure in the joke, Leonardo or the little scamp, that
jackanapes Jacopo. Only a good man could laugh as does
Leonardo! I swear it is not true what Cesare says of him!
The Master set down in his note-book the effect produced by
terror upon Maturina's wrinkles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He speaks scarce at all of women. Once, however, he said
that men maltreat them even as they do their beasts. He
ridicules the platonic love which is the fashion; and when a
certain youth read to him a peevish sonnet in the manner of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Petrarch, he replied in three lines, about Petrarch's loving
Laura merely to season his own daily food.</p>

<p>Cesare says that Leonardo has so wasted himself on
mechanics and geometry that he has had no time for love of
women. But he adds, depend upon it he is no Galahad; he
must certainly have embraced a woman at least once, out
of mere curiosity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I should never have talked to Cesare about Leonardo. We
seem to watch him like spies, and Cesare finds a malevolent
pleasure in detecting new blots in his character. And what
does Cesare want with me? Why does he poison my mind?</p>

<p>We now frequently visit a scurvy little tavern by the
Cantarana Canal, just beyond the Porta Vercellina. We talk
for hours over a half-flagon of sour wine, amid the oaths of
boatmen who finger filthy cards and lay plots together for
extortion. To-day Cesare asked me if I knew that at
Florence Leonardo had been accused of immorality. I could
not believe my ears, and thought him raving or drunken. Then
he told me the story in detail. When Leonardo was twenty-four
years of age, and his master, the famous Florentine,
Andrea Verrocchio, forty&mdash;an anonymous charge against them
both was put into one of those round wooden boxes called
<i>tamburi</i>, which hang on the pillars in the churches, most
notably in the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore. In April
'the guardians of the night and of monasteries' inquired into
the matter, and acquitted the accused on the condition, however,
that the charge should be repeated. The fresh accusation
was made in June, and they both were finally acquitted.
Nothing more was heard of the accusation; but Leonardo
soon left Verrocchio and Florence, and came hither to Milan.</p>

<p>'Oh, doubtless, 'tis an abominable calumny,' said Cesare
with his meaning smile; 'though, friend Giovanni, you do not
yet know what contradictions nestle in his heart. 'Tis a
labyrinth so intricate that even the devil would lose himself
therein. He certainly appears chaste, but&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>I had started to my feet, probably pale enough, and cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>'How dare you, Cesare?'</p>

<p>'What the devil is the matter with you? Calm yourself.
I will say no more. I was a hundred miles from <i>that</i>
construction&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What are you insinuating? Speak out!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
'What folly is this? Why so hot? Is it worth the
separating of two such friends as we? Rather let us drink.
To your health, sir. <i>In vino veritas.</i>'</p>

<p>And we drank and resumed our talk.</p>

<p>But no, no! this suffices! I will forget it; I will abstain
from speaking of the Master with this man. Cesare is not his
enemy alone, but also mine. He is a bad fellow.</p>

<p>Now I feel nauseated. It is odious to see the hideous
delight some men feel when they have thrown mud upon
the great.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Master says: 'Thy strength, O painter, is in solitude!
When you are alone you belong wholly to yourself (<i>Se tu
sarai solo tu sarai tutto tuo</i>), but if you have even one companion
then you are only half your own; possibly less than
half if your friend be indiscreet. If you have many friends,
you fall deeper into the same slough. And if you say, "I
will withdraw myself, and practise the contemplation of
Nature," you will not succeed, for you will be lending one ear
to the chatterings of your friends, and inasmuch as no man
can serve two masters, you will perform ill the duties of a
friend, and still worse the observances of art. And if you
say, "I will withdraw beyond the reach of their voices," then
you will be reckoned a madman, and you practically end
by being alone.</p>

<p>'But if you must have company, let it be that of the
painters and scholars in your studio; all other friendships
will be to your detriment. Remember, O painter, that your
strength is in solitude!'</p>

<p>Leonardo consorts not with women, because his soul
must be absolutely free.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sometimes Andrea Salaino complains that our existence
alternates between the monotony of hard work and the tedium
of inaction; and he declares that the pupils of other Masters
lead a gayer life. He is as fond of fine clothes as a maid,
and would like the noise of feastings and merriment and the
fire of amorous eyes.</p>

<p>Leonardo to-day, having overheard the reproaches and
laments of his favourite, stroked his long curls affectionately,
and said smiling:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
'Be of good cheer, lad. I'll take you to the next feast
at the castle. Meantime, shall I tell you a fable?'</p>

<p>Andrea clapped his hands like a child, and threw himself
at the Master's feet, all attention. Leonardo began:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Once upon a time a large stone, lately washed up by the
stream, lay in a retired place high up above the road and
surrounded by trees, moss, flowers, and grasses. Looking
down on his road he saw a number of stones like himself,
and he said, "What profit have I here among these short-lived
plants? I will descend among my kinsmen and live with
stones like myself." Thereupon he rolled himself down to the
road, and took a place amongst his brothers. And the wheels
of heavy wains ground him, and the hoof of the ass, and
the nailed boot of the pedestrian. Then he lifted himself a
little, and thought he should breathe more freely; but, lo!
became bespattered with mud, and the droppings of animals;
and his former fair retreat in the garden of flowers seemed to
him a paradise. Thus it is, Andrea, with those who leave
their meditation and plunge into city disquiet.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The master permits harm to no living creatures, not even
to plants. Zoroastro tells me that from an early age he has
abjured meat, and says that the time shall come when all
men such as he will be content with a vegetable diet, and
will think on the murder of animals as now they think on the
murder of men.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To-day we passed by a butcher's shop, and he pointed to
the dead carcases of calves and oxen and pigs, and said with
disgust:&mdash;'Truly man is the king of beasts, for his brutality
exceeds theirs.' And then added sorrowfully: 'We live by
the death of others. We are burial-places.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>God forgive me, I have again been with Cesare to that
accursed tavern! We spoke of the Master's compassionateness
for animals.</p>

<p>'You refer, Giovanni, to his eating no flesh?'</p>

<p>'It may be so. I know&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You know nothing! Messer Leonardo is not moved by
goodness, but by the love of singularity.'</p>

<p>'What mean you by that?'</p>

<p>He laughed somewhat forcedly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>'Peace. Let us not quarrel. Wait, and I will show you
certain of his drawings&mdash;i' faith, very interesting drawings.'</p>

<p>So upon our return we crept, thief-like, into the Master's
studio. Cesare rummaged till he had found a certain concealed
sketch-book which he showed to me. My conscience
pricked me; nevertheless I looked with interest.</p>

<p>They were drawings of colossal bombards, explosive balls,
many-barrelled guns, and such like engines of war, executed
with no less delicacy than he lavished on the divine countenances
of his Madonnas. Especially do I remember one
bomb, half a <i>braccio</i> in diameter, called 'Fragilità,' the construction
of which Cesare explained to me. It was cast of
bronze, the hollow within being filled with layers of gypsum.
Leonardo had written on the margin beside the sketch:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Most beautiful bomb. Very useful. After leaving the
gun it ignites while one might pronounce an <i>Ave Maria</i>.'</p>

<p>'<i>Ave Maria!</i>' cried Cesare. 'How does this use of a
Christian prayer please you, my friend? You see the breed
of his inventions! And have you heard his definition of
war?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'"<i>Pazzia bestialissima</i>, the most brutal of madnesses." A
pretty definition, methinks, for the inventor of these engines.
Here is your holy man who eats no flesh, who lifts a worm
from the path lest a boot should tread on it! Both one and
the other simultaneously! to-day a devil, to-morrow a saint.
A Janus, with one face toward Christ, the other towards Antichrist.
Which is the true Leonardo, which the false! Who
can say? And he does it all with a light heart, with a mystic
seductive grace. <i>He is at play.</i>'</p>

<p>I listened in silence, a chill like the chill of death piercing
my heart.</p>

<p>'Eh? What is the matter, friend Giovanni? Quite chapfallen?
You take it overmuch to heart. Oh, you'll soon
be used to it, just as I am. And now let us go back to
the <i>Tartaruga d'oro</i>, and sing:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
To-day Marco d'Oggionno said to the Master:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Messer Leonardo, they accuse us of too scanty church-going,
and of work on holy days as on others.'</p>

<p>'Let bigots talk at leisure, and heed them not,' answered
Leonardo. 'The study of Nature is well-pleasing to God,
and is akin to prayer. Learning the laws of Nature, we
magnify the first Inventor, the Designer of the world; and
we learn to love Him, for great love of God results from great
knowledge. Who knows little, loves little. If you love the
Creator for the favour you expect of Him, and not for His
most high goodness and strength, wherein do you excel the
dog who licks his master's hand in the hope of dainties?
But reflect how that worthy beast, the dog, would adore his
master could he comprehend his reason and his soul! Remember,
children, love is the daughter of knowledge; and
the deeper the knowledge of God the greater the fervency
of love. Wherefore in the Scripture it is written, "Be ye wise
as serpents and harmless as doves."'</p>

<p>'But who,' retorted Cesare, 'can combine the sweetness
of the dove with the cunning of the serpent? To my thinking
we must choose between the two.'</p>

<p>'Not so,' cried Leonardo; 'there must be a fusion. <span class="smcap">I
tell you perfect knowledge of the Universe and
perfect love of God are one thing and the same.</span>'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How fain would I return to thy silent and holy cell, O
Fra Benedetto! Tell thee all my grief, and fall upon thy
breast, that thou mightest pity me and remove from my
soul this burden, O beloved father! O gentle shepherd, who
dost abide by the word of Christ&mdash;'Blessed are the poor in
spirit!'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At times the Master's face is so peaceful and innocent, so
full of dovelike harmlessness, that I am ready to pardon all, to
believe all, to trust him with my very soul. Then of a sudden
the subtle lines of his lips take on an expression so incomprehensible,
something which so inspires me with fear, that I
seem to be looking through the transparency of water into
the profundity of the abyss. There is in his soul some
impenetrable mystery; and I recall one of his sayings:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Very deep rivers flow underground.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
The Duke Gian Galeazzo is dead; and they say that
Leonardo has been the occasion of his death by means of
poisoned fruit. God is my witness, that 'tis not of my own
will I lend an ear unto this terrible accusation, and that I
would fain reject it out of hand. Yet there stands ever before
my eyes that vision of the tree, with its leaves distilling dew,
and its fatal fruit maturing in the greenish mist, lit by the
moon, pregnant with terror and death. Oh, that I had never
seen it!</p>

<p>'"Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but
of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not
eat of it, for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
surely die."'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Out of the depths I cry unto thee, O Lord! Lord hear my
voice; let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications!
Like the thief upon the Cross, I confess Thy name:
Remember me, O Lord, when Thou comest into Thy kingdom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Leonardo has begun to work on the countenance of the
Christ.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The duke has commanded him to construct an engine
for raising the Holy Nail. With mathematical accuracy
he weighs in a scale the instrument of the Passion of the
Saviour, as if it were a fragment of old iron; so many
ounces, so many grains. To him it is only a figure among
figures; a part among parts of a lifting machine; ropes,
wheels, levers, and pulleys.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Says the apostle, 'Little children, it is the last time: and
as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are
there many antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last
time.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To-night a crowd of people demanding the Holy Nail surrounded
our house, crying, 'Sorcerer! infidel! poisoner!
Antichrist!' Amused, Leonardo listened to the howl of the
mob, and when Marco would have discharged his arquebus
at them, it was the Master who restrained him.</p>

<p>The Master did not change from his impenetrable serenity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
and when I fell at his feet supplicating a word, a single word,
to dispel my doubts&mdash;and I swear by God I should have
believed him&mdash;he would not or could not speak.</p>

<p>Little Jacopo, stealing out, evaded the crowd, and having
met the guard of the captain of justice, led them to the
house: and at the instant when the doors were giving way
under the weight and the blows of the crowd, soldiers took
them in the rear, and the rioters scattered. Jacopo is
wounded, struck on the head by a stone, and like to die.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To-day I assisted in the cathedral at the Feast of the most
Holy Nail. At the moment recommended by the astrologers
it was raised on high. Leonardo's machine acted without a
hitch: neither rope nor pulley was visible. Through clouds
of incense the round casket with the crystal sides and the
golden rays in which the nail was set, rose of itself like the
rising sun. 'Twas a triumph of mechanics! The choir
sang:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Confixa clavis viscera</p>
<p>&nbsp;Tendens manus vestigia</p>
<p>&nbsp;Redemptionis gratia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Hic immolata est Hostia.'</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the casket was arrested and lodged in a dark niche
above the high altar, surrounded by five ever-flaming lamps.</p>

<p>The Archbishop intoned:&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>O Crux benedicta quae sola fuisti digna portare Regem
cælorum et Dominum, Alleluia!</i>'</p>

<p>The whole assembled multitude fell on their knees repeating
Alleluia!</p>

<p>And the usurper of the throne of Milan, Ludovico the
assassin, prostrated himself with the rest, and weeping, raised
his hands to the Holy Nail.</p>

<p>After which the populace was glutted with wine, with the
flesh of beasts, with five thousand measures of pease, and six
hundredweight of salt. Forgetting their murdered lord, they
feasted and drank, and cried&mdash;'<i>Viva Il Moro! Viva il Chiodo!</i>'</p>

<p>Bellincioni has composed some hexameters, in which we
learn that by virtue of the ancient nail of iron the age of gold
shall be renewed.</p>

<p>After leaving the cathedral the duke came to Leonardo and
embraced him; kissing his lips, calling him his Archimedes,
and, thanking him for the beautiful machine, he promised to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
present him with a pure-blooded Barbary mare and two
thousand imperial ducats. Then condescendingly tapping
him on the shoulder, he said, 'Now you'll have time to finish
the head of your Christ.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.'</p>

<p>I can no longer endure my torment; I perish; I become
crazed! My reason loses itself in the duplicity of these
thoughts.</p>

<p>Fly, fly, ere it be too late!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I rose in the night-time, tied up my clothes and my books
in a bundle, took a thick stick, felt my way through the
darkness to the studio, where I left on the table the thirty
florins which I owe for the last six months' teaching&mdash;I have
sold my mother's emerald ring to do this&mdash;and without
leave-takings, abandoned Leonardo's house for ever.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fra Benedetto tells me that from the time I left him he
has not ceased to pray for me; and he has had a revelation
in his sleep that God has brought me back into the true path.
He is faring to Florence to visit his sick brother, a Dominican
in the monastery of San Marco, where Fra Girolamo Savonarola
is prior.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Praise and thanksgiving unto Thee, O Lord! Thou hast
brought me out of the shadow of death, from the mouth of
the pit. I renounce to-day the wisdom of this world, upon
which is the seal of the dragon with the seven heads, the beast
which walketh in darkness, which is Antichrist. I renounce
the fruit of the poisonous tree of knowledge, the pride of vain
understanding, of that wisdom which is inimical to God, of
whom the Devil is the father.</p>

<p>I renounce every aspiration after the enchantments of the
world. I renounce all that is not subordinated to Thy glory,
Thy will, Thy wisdom, O Christ!</p>

<p>Illumine my soul with Thy light, deliver me from fatal
duplicity of thought; make sure my footsteps in Thy paths,
and shelter me under the shadow of Thy wings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
My soul, praise the Lord! I will praise the Lord so long
as I have my being; I will yet sing praises unto my God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two days hence, Fra Benedetto and I go to Florence. I
desire, with the blessing of this my second father, to enter
as novice in the Convent of San Marco, under the guidance of
the holy and elect Fra Girolamo Savonarola.</p>

<h3 class="p2">I</h3>

<p>More than a year had passed since Giovanni Boltraffio had
been received as a novice in the Convent of San Marco.</p>

<p>On a winter's day towards the close of the carnival of 1496,
shortly after noon, Fra Girolamo was writing the account of a
vision which had lately appeared to him. He had seen two
crosses waving above the city of Rome, one black and
enveloped in storm, inscribed&mdash;'The Cross of the fury of the
Lord'; the other of gleaming azure, with the inscription&mdash;'The
Cross of the Lord's mercy.'</p>

<p>February sunshine flooded the narrow cell with its white
and naked walls, great black crucifix, and the thick parchment
books in antique leather. Now and then from the blue sky
came the joyous twitter of the swallows.</p>

<p>Fra Girolamo felt unwonted weariness, and now and then
trembled. Laying down his pen, he dropped his head on
his hands, closed his eyes, and meditated upon what he
had that morning heard about Pope Alexander <span class="smcap lowercase">VI</span>. from
Fra Paolo, a monk who had been on a secret mission to
Rome. Monstrous images like those described in the
Apocalypse passed and whirled before the mind of the
prior; he saw the blood-stained bull of the shield of the
Borgias, reminding him of Apis, the heathen god; the golden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
calf borne before the pontiff instead of the humble Lamb of
God; nightly orgies at the Vatican in the presence of the
Holy Father, of his favourite daughter, and of the College of
Cardinals; the beautiful Giulia Farnese, mistress of the
sexagenarian pope, and the model for contemporary portraits
of the saints; his two sons, Cesare the young Cardinal of
Valenza, and Giovanni the Duke of Candia, who out of criminal
love for Lucrezia their sister, hated each other to the point
of fratricide. And haunted by what Fra Paolo had scarcely
dared to whisper, the tale of the strange relations between the
pope and this Lucrezia his daughter, Girolamo trembled.</p>

<p>'But no, 'tis calumny. It were too great an enormity!
God sees that I cannot believe it,' he murmured.</p>

<p>But in the depths of his soul he felt that nothing was
impossible in that terrible nest of the Borgias, and drops of
cold sweat stood out upon his forehead. He had fallen on his
knees before the crucifix, when a low knocking was heard at
the door of his cell.</p>

<p>'Who is it?'</p>

<p>'It is I, father.'</p>

<p>He recognized the voice of his trusty friend, Fra Domenico
Buonvicino.</p>

<p>'Ricciardo Becchi, secret legate from the pope, prays for
an audience.'</p>

<p>'Good. Let him wait. Meanwhile send me Fra Silvestro.'</p>

<p>Fra Silvestro Maruffi was epileptic and of weak intellect,
but Fra Girolamo, considering him a chosen vessel of the grace
of God, both loved and feared him. He interpreted Maruffi's
visions according to the precise rules of St. Thomas Aquinas
and the Schoolmen, finding by ingenuity, by the arguments
of logic, by enthymemes, apophthegms, and syllogisms,
prophetical meaning in the vain babble of an idiot. Maruffi
showed no respect for his superior, insulted him publicly, and
even struck him; offences which Fra Girolamo received with
the utmost meekness. So that if the people of Florence were
in the hands of Savonarola, Savonarola was in the hands of
the half-witted Maruffi.</p>

<p>Having entered, Fra Silvestro sat on the floor and scratched
furiously at his red and naked feet, chanting a monotonous
song. His face was freckled, with a sharp nose, and a hanging
lower lip. His rheumy eyes of a dull green were melancholy.</p>

<p>'Brother,' said Savonarola, 'the pope has sent me a secret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
messenger. Tell me, shall I receive him? What should I
say? Have you had any voice or vision?'</p>

<p>Maruffi grimaced, barked and grunted. He had great gifts
in the imitation of animals.</p>

<p>'Beloved Brother,' said Savonarola, 'be kind! Speak!
My soul faints under the burden of mortal sadness. Pray
God that He illuminate thee with His spirit of prophecy.'</p>

<p>The other opened wide his mouth and rolled his tongue;
his face was strangely contorted; and he burst out angrily:</p>

<p>'Why should you trouble me, you tedious talker, you
sheep's-head, you brainless quail? May the rats devour your
nose! You have made your bed&mdash;lie on it. I am neither
prophet nor councillor.'</p>

<p>He paused, looked at Savonarola from under his scowling
eyebrows, and continued more quietly:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Brother, I'm sorry for you! But as for my visions, how
know you if they come from God or from the devil?'</p>

<p>Silvestro closed his eyes. His countenance took an expression
of repose. Savonarola held his breath in holy
expectancy.</p>

<p>Suddenly Maruffi opened his eyes, slowly turned his head
like one listening, looked out of the window, and a smile of
good nature, peace, almost of intelligence, brightened his face.</p>

<p>'The birds!' he said; 'do you hear the birds? To be
sure, the grass is springing in the meadows, and the first
little yellow flowers! 'Tis enough. It's time to think of God
now. Come! let us flee this sinful world; let us flee together
to the desert!' And rocking himself, he began to sing in a
sweet, lazy voice.</p>

<p>Suddenly he sprang to his feet, ran to Savonarola, seized
his hand and cried, choking with excitement:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I have seen&mdash;I have seen&mdash;May the rats devour your
nose! You head of an ass&mdash;I have seen&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Speak, dear brother; speak quickly!'</p>

<p>'Flames! Flames!' cried Maruffi.</p>

<p>'Well? And besides?'</p>

<p>'Flames rising from a stake, and in the midst of the flames
a man&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Who?'</p>

<p>Nodding his head, and motioning with his hand, Silvestro
did not reply at once; then fixing his penetrating eyes on the
other, he laughed softly and foolishly, and murmured:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
'Thou!'</p>

<p>Fra Girolamo shuddered, paled, and drew back involuntarily.
Maruffi turned away, and shambled out of the cell,
singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Hie we to the smiling woods,</p>
<p class="i1">The shy retreat of spring,</p>
<p>Where the streams unsealèd flow,</p>
<p class="i1">And the yellow-hammers sing!'</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Recovering himself, Fra Girolamo gave orders to admit
His Magnificence Ricciardo Becchi.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>II</h3>

<p>This man, Scriptor of the Papal Court of Chancery,
entered Savonarola's cell, rustling a long silk garment shaped
like the habit of a monk, but of the modish violet colour,
and with hanging embroidered sleeves lined with fox-skin, his
whole person emitting a perfume of musk. The studied
grace of his movements, his pleasant and intelligent smile,
his calm eyes, his dimpled and well-shaven cheek, showed
him a master of dignified urbanity. He bent in a courtly
reverence, kissed the hand of the Prior of San Marco, and
asked his blessing; then entered upon a long speech in Latin
beflowered with Ciceronianisms and resounding sententiousness.
He began with what in the rules of oratory is called
the appeal for goodwill, dilating upon the fame of the
Florentine preacher; then he gradually approached the
mission entrusted to him. The Holy Father, though righteously
angered by Fra Girolamo's refusal to present himself
in Rome, nevertheless burning with zeal for the Church's
good, for the perfect union of the faithful in Christ, and for
the peace of the whole world, declared his fatherly readiness,
in the event of Fra Girolamo's repentance, to restore him to
favour.</p>

<p>Savonarola raised his eyes and said very quietly:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Messere, what think you? do you believe that the Holy
Father and our lord has faith in Christ?'</p>

<p>Ricciardo allowed this unseemly question to pass without
reply; he continued to dilate on his mission, giving the prior
to understand that if he submitted himself, the red hat of
a cardinal awaited him in Rome; then, bowing a second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
time, and touching Savonarola's hand with his lips, he added
insinuatingly:&mdash;</p>

<p>'One little word, Father Girolamo, one little word, and the
red hat is yours.'</p>

<p>Savonarola fixed his unflinching eyes on the speaker, and
said slowly:&mdash;</p>

<p>'And if I refuse to submit, Messere? If I refuse to
hold my peace? If the infatuated monk prefer to continue
his barkings as the faithful watch-dog of the house of
God?'</p>

<p>Raising his eyebrows in a faint grimace, Messer Ricciardo
looked at the monk, then turned his eyes to his beautiful
almond-shaped nails, and adjusted his priceless rings. Presently
he drew slowly from his pocket, unfolded, and handed
to the prior a bull of excommunication, to which nothing was
lacking but the papal seal. In it Savonarola was called the son
of perdition, 'the most contemptible of insects' <i>neauissimus
omnipedum</i>.</p>

<p>'And you are waiting for an answer?' asked the monk
quietly, when he had read the document.</p>

<p>The Scriptor assented with a light nod of his head.</p>

<p>Savonarola rose, and flung the bull at the feet of the
emissary.</p>

<p>'There,' he said, 'there is my answer! Return to Rome
and tell him who has sent you that I accept his challenge.
Minister of Antichrist! We shall see whether he will excommunicate
me, or whether it is I who shall drive him out of
the pale of the Church!'</p>

<p>The door of the cell was softly opened and showed the
head of Fra Domenico who, hearing the sonorous voice, was
anxious to know what could be taking place. The monks
were massed round the entrance.</p>

<p>Messer Ricciardo, who had cast several furtive glances at
the door, now said politely:&mdash;</p>

<p>'May I remind you, Fra Girolamo, that I am charged only
with a private mission?'</p>

<p>Savonarola moved to the door, and throwing it wide he
cried:&mdash;'Hear all of ye; for not only to you but to the whole
people of Florence I will proclaim the infamous traffic which
has been proposed to me, choice between the cardinal's
purple and the excommunication of the <i>Curia Romana</i>!'
Under his low forehead his sunken eyes shone like coals;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
his ill-shaped lower jaw, trembling with wrath and almost
satanic hatred and pride.</p>

<p>'Yea, the hour has come! I will thunder against you, all
ye prelates and cardinals of Rome, even as once the holy
fathers thundered against the pagans. I will force the key of
this unclean house; the Church of God, which you have slain,
shall hear my cry: "Lazarus, come forth!" and shall raise
its head and issue from its tomb! What need I your mitres
and your cardinal's hats? Give me the red hat of death;
the blood-stained crown of martyrdom!'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Among the monks who crowded to hear these words of
Savonarola was the novice, Giovanni Boltraffio. When the
company had dispersed, he too descended by the main staircase
of the convent, and sat in his accustomed spot under
the portico, where at this hour reigned solitude and calm.</p>

<p>The court was surrounded by the white monastery walls,
and in it grew laurels, cypresses, and a thicket of damask
roses. Report said that these roses were watered by angels.
Fra Girolamo loved to preach amongst them.</p>

<p>The novice opened the Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians,
and read: 'Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and
the cup of devils; ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table
and of the table of devils.'</p>

<p>Then he rose and paced the cloister, recalling his thoughts
and emotions during the year he had spent within the walls
of San Marco. After the moral torture of the preceding
months, he had at first experienced great peace in this retreat
among the disciples of Savonarola.</p>

<p>Sometimes Father Girolamo would lead them out beyond
the confines of the city. Following a steep path, which
seemed to lead to heaven, they climbed the heights of
Fiesole, from whence the City of Flowers, surrounded by
smiling hills, appeared like some silver vision. The prior
would seat himself in a meadow, enamelled with iris,
tulips, and violets; the monks reclined in a circle round
him, and talked and danced and frolicked like so many
children, or played on viols and citherns, like those which the
<i>beato Angelico</i> placed in the hands of his angels, circling as
they sing in the choir of heaven. Fra Girolamo did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
preach nor play the master, but talked affectionately and
took his part in the games and laughter. And Giovanni,
looking at the radiant smile on his countenance, there on the
retired Fiesole hill, under the heaven of most pure azure,
hearing the vibrating tones of the stringed instruments, and
the voices blended in holy song, fancied himself an angel in
the paradise of God. Sometimes at dawn Savonarola would
walk to the edge of the slope, and look down on his Florence,
bathed in the morning mist, even as a mother looks on her
sleeping babe, and from below would rise the first clanging of
the bells announcing the beginning of day, like the sleepy
babble of a half-awakened child.</p>

<p>And on summer nights, when the fireflies moved through
the embalmed air like the torches of unseen angels, and
the roses exhaled their mystic odour in the convent-yard,
Fra Girolamo would tell of the stigmata of St. Francis, of the
wounds, perfumed like roses, which her divine love had
impressed on the tender body of St. Catharine. The brethren
sang:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Fac me plagis vulnerari,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Fac me Cruce inebriari,</p>
<p class="i1">Ob amorem Filii.'</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And Giovanni would tremble in the anguished expectation
of miracle&mdash;the trembling hope that rays of fire, springing
from the cup of the Holy Sacrament, would burn his body
likewise with the sacred wounds of the Crucified. '<i>Gesù,
Gesù mio, amore!</i>' he sighed, fainting in voluptuous ecstasy.</p>

<p>Once the prior sent him on a mission to the Villa Carreggi,
two miles from Florence, where Lorenzo dei Medici had long
sojourned, and at last had died. In one of the deserted
saloons, lit by a ghostly light coming through the chinks of
the shutters, Giovanni saw a picture of Botticelli's, called 'The
Birth of Venus.'</p>

<p>White as a water-lily, bedewed with the briny freshness of
the sea, standing on a pearly shell, the goddess floated over
the waves, veiled in the abundant gold of her serpentine
tresses, which she gathered in her hand. The fair naked
body breathed the enticement of sin; yet was there a strange
pathos in the pure childlike lips and the innocent eyes.</p>

<p>Giovanni shuddered; for it seemed to him that the face of
the goddess was not new to him; he looked long at it, and
remembered that he had already seen that countenance, those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
ingenuous, dewy eyes, those innocent lips with their tender
sadness in another picture by that same Botticelli&mdash;a picture
of the Mother of God. Inexpressible consternation filled his
soul; he averted his eyes and fled from the villa.</p>

<p>Returning to Florence by a narrow lane, he saw at the
angle of a cross-way an ancient Rood, and he sank on his
knees and prayed for the driving from him of temptation.
But at that moment came the trill of a mandoline from the
roses behind the wall; a voice cried out, then murmured in a
frightened whisper, 'No, no&mdash;leave me!' and another voice
replied, 'Beloved! Love!&mdash;my love!' and then the mandoline
fell, and a kiss was heard.</p>

<p>Giovanni sprang to his feet, reiterating, '<i>Gesù! Gesù!</i>' but
this time he dared not add '<i>amore!</i>'</p>

<p>'Here also is <i>she</i>!' he said; 'everywhere! in the face of
the Madonna, in the words of the holy hymns, in the breath
of the roses which crown the crucifix!'</p>

<p>And hiding his face in his hands he fled, as if escaping
from an unseen persecution.</p>

<p>Back in the convent, he went to Savonarola and told him
all, and the prior exhorted him to fight against the devil by
fasting and by prayer; and when the novice sought to explain
that this torment was not the temptation of fleshly lust, but
the seduction breathing from all the beauty of pagan antiquity,
Savonarola, uncomprehending, at first showed astonishment,
then told him sternly that he lied in thinking there could be
aught in the pagan gods but concupiscence and pride. All
beauty was contained in the Christian virtues. And Giovanni,
not having found the looked-for comfort, from that day forth
was possessed by the demons of restlessness and revolt.</p>

<p>Once Boltraffio heard Fra Girolamo, discoursing on
painting, insist that every picture should have some moral
utility for men, exciting them to the practice of those ascetic
virtues which alone are healthful for the soul. And he added
that the Florentines would do a work well-pleasing to God
if they should destroy, at the hands of the executioner, all
those images which entice to sin.</p>

<p>Then he went on to speak of knowledge:&mdash;'That man is a
fool,' he said 'who conceives that by logic and by philosophy
the truths of faith can be confirmed. Does a strong light
need the help of a weak one? or the divine wisdom that of
the human? Which of the apostles and the martyrs studied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
philosophy and logic? An old woman who can neither read
nor write, but who prays fervently before the image of a saint,
is nearer to the knowledge of God than all the sages and
philosophers of the world. Neither logic nor science will
stead them in the day of judgment: Homer and Virgil, Plato
and Aristotle, all go to their end in the house of the devil;
because, like the sirens, bewitching the ear with magic songs,
they draw souls to eternal ruin. Science gives men stones
for bread, and, verily, if you look at those who follow the
teaching of this world, you will find in them that even their
hearts are become as stones.'</p>

<p>'Who knows little, loves little. Great love is the daughter
of great knowledge!' had said Leonardo da Vinci.</p>

<p>Only now did Giovanni realise the profundity of these
words, as he listened to the anathema of the monk against
knowledge and art, and remembered the wise reasonings of
Leonardo, the calm of his countenance, his cold look, his
wise and enchanting smile. Not that he had forgotten the
poisoned tree, the Ear, the crane for the Holy Nail, but
now he felt that he had not fathomed the depth of his
master's soul, had not penetrated into the mysteries of his
heart, nor untied the prime knot in which all the threads must
meet.</p>

<p>Such were the memories upon which Giovanni looked back
at the end of his first convent year. Deep in thought he
paced the darkening cloister, till the evening had fallen and
the <i>Ave Maria</i> rang through the dusk. The monks wended
to the chapel, but Giovanni remained outside, reseating
himself.</p>

<p>Then with a bitter smile he raised his eyes to the silent
heaven, where shone the evening star, the torch of Lucifer,
the most beautiful of angels, the bringer of light, son of
the morning.</p>

<p>He returned to his cell and slept: towards the dawning he
dreamed. And in his dream he was with Monna Cassandra,
astride of a black goat, and fleeting through the morning air,
'To the Sabbath! to the Sabbath!' cried the witch, turning
to him her clear amber eyes; and he knew in her the goddess
of earthly love, she with the heavenly sadness in her eyes&mdash;the
<i>diavolessa bianca</i>. The full moon shone on her body.
Sweet odours almost overpowered him. His teeth chattered
with desire and with fear. '<i>Amore! Amore!</i>' she cried and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
laughed, and the black goat-skin sank beneath them. Away!
Away! they careered.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Giovanni was awakened by the sun, by the sound of bells
and of childish voices. He dressed hurriedly, and descended
into the court where was a great crowd of people, and among
them children all dressed in white, and carrying olive-branches
and small red crosses. It was 'The Sacred Legion of the
Child Inquisitors,' founded by Savonarola to watch over and
reform the purity of morals in the town. Giovanni mixed in
the crowd, and listened to their talk.</p>

<p>Then a wave passed over the ranks of the sacred troop;
innumerable small hands waved the olive-branches and the
red crosses above their heads, acclaiming Savonarola, who
was entering, and a chorus of silver voices intoned a psalm
in his honour:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
'<i>Lumen ad revelationem gentium et gloriam plebis Israel.</i>'
</p></blockquote>

<p>The children made a circle round the Prior, covering him
with a rain of violets and anemones, and they knelt before
him, kissing his feet. Illumined by a ray of the sun, silently,
with a tender smile, the worn-faced Savonarola blessed them.</p>

<p>'Long live Christ, King of Florence! Hallelujah to Christ,
the King of Florence. Hail Mary, Blessed Virgin, and our
Queen!' shouted the young voices.</p>

<p>The captains gave the order to march, drums beat, flags
fluttered, and the sacred troop moved off. For in the Piazza
della Signoria was prepared the pyre for the burning of the
vanities, and the children were once more to make the
circuit of the city to collect 'vanities and things under
anathema.'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>V</h3>

<p>When the court was clear, Giovanni saw Messer Cipriano
Buonaccorsi, Master of the noble Guild of the Calimala,
the lover of pagan antiquities, on whose property by the Hill
of the Mill the marble figure of the goddess of Love had been
found. They greeted each other warmly, and spoke for some
time. From Messer Cipriano Giovanni learned that Leonardo
had come from Milan, charged by the duke to purchase such
works of art as could escape the Legion of Children. Giorgio
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Merula was with the painter. Presently Messer Cipriano
asked Giovanni to conduct him to Savonarola. The master
of the Calimala entered Fra Girolamo's cell, and Giovanni
waiting outside heard their talk. Messer Cipriano offered
twenty-two thousand gold florins if he might buy all the
books, the pictures, the statues, and other treasures which
were ordained for the burning. Savonarola refused. Messer
Cipriano increased his offer by eight thousand florins. To
this the Monk deigned no reply; only his stern and rigid
face became yet sterner and more rigid. Buonaccorsi's
toothless mouth quivered. He wrapped his fox-skin cloak
round his shivering knees; he sighed heavily, and closing his
myopic eyes, he said in his quiet voice: 'Well, Father
Girolamo, I will ruin myself. I will give you all I possess:
forty thousand florins.'</p>

<p>Savonarola grimly raised his head. 'And what were your
profit,' he asked, 'if you ruined yourself?'</p>

<p>'I was born in this city,' replied Messer Cipriano. 'I love
my land; and for no condition in the world can I endure that
we, like the barbarian hordes, should destroy the masterpieces
of wisdom and of art.'</p>

<p>'Would that thou didst love thy heavenly country as thou
lovest thine earthly one, my son!' exclaimed the Monk,
turning on the old man a look full of admiration; 'but
be consoled, only things meet for burning shall be burned.
What induces to wickedness and vice cannot include anything
of beauty, as, indeed, your same wise ancients have
said.'</p>

<p>'Alas, father!' returned the merchant, eagerly, 'are you
certain that babes can distinguish so precisely between the
evil and the good?'</p>

<p>'Truth and innocency is in the mouth of babes. "Except
ye become as children ye cannot enter into the kingdom of
heaven." Is it not written: "I will destroy the wisdom of
the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the
prudent"? Messere, I pray day and night that God may
enlighten my babes, so that by His Holy Spirit their minds
may be opened to discover all the vanities of science and
of art.'</p>

<p>'I beseech you to consider&mdash;perhaps even a part&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You are wasting your breath, messere. My decision is
unalterable.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Again Messer Cipriano's old lips moved, but Savonarola
heard only one word&mdash;'Madness!'</p>

<p>'Madness?' he echoed, his eyes flashing; 'and the golden
calf of the Borgias offered to the pope in his sacrilegious
festivals&mdash;is that not madness? And the elevation of the Holy
Nail, to the glory of God, by a diabolical machine at the
command of an impious assassin and usurper&mdash;is that not
madness? You dance madly round the golden calf in
honour of your God, which is Mammon; let us, then, who
are poor in spirit, be mad in honour of our God, who is
Christ Jesus the Crucified. You bemock the monks who on
the piazza dance around the cross. Wait! There are other
spectacles which wait for you. What will you wise men say
when I lead not only the monks, but the whole people of
Florence, adults as well as children, men and women, to
dance around the Cross-Tree of Salvation, as of old David
danced before the Ark of the Covenant to the glory of the
Most High!'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Leaving the prior's cell, Giovanni Boltraffio turned his
steps towards the Piazza della Signoria. In Via Larga he
met the sacred troop. The children had stopped a palanquin
carried by black slaves, in which reclined a woman
gorgeously attired. A lapdog slept on her knee, a parrot
and a monkey were on perches by her side, the litter was
followed by servants and by guards. She was a courtesan,
Lena Griffi, not long come from Venice, one of those whom
the most Serene Republic called '<i>meretrix honesta</i>,' or playfully
'Mammola' (little dear); and whose name in the placard,
drawn up for the convenience of travellers, was set down
in large characters and in a place of honour at the top of the
list.</p>

<p>Lolling on her cushions like Cleopatra, or a Queen of
Sheba, Lena was reading a love-missive from a youthful
bishop. Its postscript was a song ending thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Listening to thy voice I rise</p>
<p>&nbsp;From this globe towards the skies,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Plato's Sphere of Ecstasies.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The courtesan was meditating on a return sonnet, for she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
was an accomplished versifier, and used to say that had it
depended on herself, she would gladly have passed her whole
existence in the <i>Accademia degli vomini virtuosi</i>&mdash;in the
Academy of the Virtuous.</p>

<p>The sacred troop of children encircled the litter. Dolfo,
the leader of one of the bands, advanced raising his red cross,
and cried: 'In the name of Jesus, the King of Florence, and
of the Blessed Mary our Queen, we bid you strip off these
sinful ornaments, these vanities and anathemata. And if you
refuse, may you fall under the malediction of God!'</p>

<p>The dog suddenly awakened began to bark, the monkey
chattered, the parrot, flapping its wings, screamed out a verse
it had learned from its mistress:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">'Amor che a nullo amato amar perdona!'</p></blockquote>

<p>Lena was about to bid her attendants rid her of the crowd
when her eyes fell on Dolfo, and she beckoned to him.</p>

<p>The boy came, his eyes on the ground.</p>

<p>'Away with these ornaments!' shouted the children.
'Away with the vanities and the anathemata.'</p>

<p>'Ah, you handsome boy!' said the courtesan softly, disregarding
the cries of the crowd. 'Mark you, my little
Adonis, I would willingly give you all my poor toys, but the
matter is they are not mine own!'</p>

<p>Dolfo raised his eyes; and Lena, with a scarcely perceptible
smile, nodded as if confirming his secret thoughts, then
added caressingly, in her soft Venetian accent: 'In the
Vicolo de' Bottai, near the Santa Trinità, ask for Lena, the
lady from Venice. I'll be expecting you.'</p>

<p>Dolfo looked round and saw that his followers had become
involved with a party of Savonarola's enemies (called the
<i>Arrabbiati</i>, the Enraged), and had forgotten the courtesan.
It was his duty to bid them fall upon her, but suddenly he
felt himself vanquished, and flushed and hung his head.</p>

<p>Lena laughed, showing her white teeth; and behind the
sumptuous Cleopatra and Queen of Sheba there shone out
the Venetian 'Mammola,' the saucy street-girl, mischievous
and naughty.</p>

<p>The slaves lifted the litter and she pursued her way
unmolested, spaniel on lap; the parrot settled down on
his perch; only the monkey still grimaced, and tried to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
snatch the pencil with which the courtesan was beginning
verses to the bishop:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">'My love is purer than a seraph's sigh....'</p></blockquote>

<p>Dolfo, meantime, preceding his company, but without his
former braggadocio, mounted the stair of the Palazzo dei
Medici.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>In the dark, silent, and spacious halls of the Medicean
palace, where all breathed the solemn grandeur of the past,
the children became awestruck. But when the shutters
had been flung open, the trumpets had blared, and the
drums beat, then the youthful inquisitors scattered themselves
through the rooms, shouting and laughing, and singing
hymns, and executing the judgment of God on the sins of
learning and art, gleefully prying into vanities by the guidance
of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Giovanni watched them at work, and noted some who,
with frowning foreheads, hands decently folded, and the
gravity of judges, paced among the statues of the philosophers
and heroes of pagan antiquity. 'Pythagoras, Anaximenes,
Heraclitus, Plato, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus,' read one of
the boys from the Latin inscriptions on the marble bases.</p>

<p>'Epictetus?' said Federici, with the tone of a profound
connoisseur, 'that is the particular heretic who permitted all
pleasures and denied the existence of God. He merits
burning; 'tis pity he is marble.'</p>

<p>'Never mind,' cried the cross-eyed Pippo, 'we'll have him
in to the feast.'</p>

<p>'Nay,' interposed Giovanni; 'you are confounding Epictetus
with Epicurus.'</p>

<p>He was too late; down came Pippo's hammer so clean on
the philosopher's nose that the boys yelled in admiration.</p>

<p>'Epictetus or Epicurus, it's all one! If it isn't the broth,
it's the sippets of bread! They shall all go to the house of
the devil,' they cried, quoting Fra Girolamo.</p>

<p>However, contention arose before a picture of Botticelli's.
Dolfo declared it was the naked Bacchus pierced by the
shafts of love, but Federici, whose eye for 'anathemata'
rivalled Dolfo's, examined the picture attentively and pronounced
it a portrait of Stephen the proto-martyr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
The children stood round in perplexity, for the attire and
the expression of the figure in nowise suggested a saint.</p>

<p>'Don't you believe him!' cried Dolfo; ''tis Bacchus, the
abominable Bacchus!'</p>

<p>'You blasphemer!' shouted Federici, raising his crucifix
for weapon, and the two boys fell upon each other with such
goodwill that their followers could hardly separate them.
The picture was left for future consideration.</p>

<p>Standing in wondering groups, the children rummaged
amongst the properties of old carnivals&mdash;amongst the horrid
masks of satyrs, grapes for bacchantes, bows, amongst
quivers, and wings of Eros, the wands of Hermes, the tridents
of Poseidon. Finally, drawing them forth amid shouts of
laughter, they lighted on the wooden, gilded, cobwebbed
thunderbolt of Jupiter Tonans, and the moth-eaten body of
the Olympian eagle, with moulted tail, and wires and nails
protruding from his perforated crop. A rat jumped out from
the dusty golden wig once worn by Aphrodite, girls screamed,
jumped on the couches and gathered up their petticoats. The
shadows of terrified bats beating against the ceiling seemed
the wings of unclean spirits, and a chill of horror and repulsion
settled on the children as they touched this heathen
lumber, this sepulchral dust of deities.</p>

<p>Dolfo running up announced that there was yet another
room, its door guarded by a little, bald, furious, red-nosed,
detestable man, who was hurling blasphemy and curses, and
would permit no one to pass. The troop filed off to reconnoitre;
and Giovanni, following them, found in the janitor his
friend the bibliophile, Messer Giorgio Merula.</p>

<p>Dolfo gave the signal for attack; Messer Giorgio stood
before the door preparing to defend it with his body. The
children fell upon him, rolled him over, beat him with their
crosses, searched his pockets till they had found the key, and
opened the door. It was a small room with a library of
precious books.</p>

<p>'Here, here!' suggested Merula, cunningly, 'the books
you seek are in this corner. You needn't waste your time
over the top shelves. There's nothing there.'</p>

<p>But the inquisitors heeded him not. All that came to
hand they piled in a vast heap, especially the books in
rich bindings. Then they opened the windows and flung
the fat folios straight into the street, where carts were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
being loaded with 'vanities.' Tibullus, Horace, Ovid,
Apuleius, Aristophanes, rare copies, unique editions flew
through the air before Merula's very eyes. He rescued one
small volume and hid it in his bosom. It was the history of
Marcellinus, containing the life of Julian the Apostate.
Seeing on the floor a delicately-illuminated manuscript
of the tragedies of Sophocles, he snatched it up and made
piteous supplication:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Children, dear children! spare Sophocles. He is the
most innocent of poets. Let him alone! Let him alone!'</p>

<p>And he pressed the precious leaves convulsively to his
breast, but finding them tear beneath his too loving hands he
burst into sobs and groans, dropped his treasure, and cried
in impotent fury:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Know, ye sons of dogs, that one line of this inestimable
Sophocles is worth all the prophecies put together of your
madman, Fra Girolamo.'</p>

<p>'Old man, if you don't want to be taken by the heels and
thrown after your pagan poets, you'll hold your tongue!'
cried the children, dragging him from the library.</p>

<p>Then leaving the palace, they passed by Santa Maria del
Fiore, and marched to the Piazza della Signoria.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>In front of the dark and slender tower of the Palazzo
Vecchio the pyre stood ready. It was thirty cubits in height,
one hundred and twenty in circumference; an octagonal
pyramid with at least fifteen steps. On the lowest were
the comic masks, dresses, wigs, and other carnival properties;
on the next three, profane books from Anacreon and Ovid to
the <i>Decameron</i>, and the <i>Morgante Maggiore</i> of Messer Luigi
Pulci. Above the books were the instruments of female
beauty&mdash;washes, essences, mirrors, puffs, curling-tongs, hair-pins,
nail-nippers. Still higher were lutes and mandolines,
cards, chessmen, balls, dice&mdash;all the games by means of which
men serve the devil. Then came drawings, voluptuous
pictures, portraits of light women; lastly, on the summit of
the pyramid, the gods, heroes and sages of pagan antiquity,
made of wood and of coloured wax. Above the pile, towering
higher than anything else, the figure of Satan was enthroned,
the lord of all 'vanities and things accursed,' a monstrous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
puppet, filled with gunpowder and sulphur, with goat's legs
and a hairy skin, like Pan, the ancient god of the woods.</p>

<p>It was evening: the air was cold, but serene and clear, and
one by one the stars were beginning their nightly shining.
The crowd in the piazza surged and swayed, and pious murmurings
filled the air. Hymns went up from Savonarola's
followers&mdash;<i>Laudi spirituali</i>&mdash;which retaining the rhymes, the
metre, and the air of carnival songs, had been radically
changed in words and sense. Giovanni listened, and the
incongruity between the lively music and the gloomy words
resounded in his ears like some barbarous funeral chant.</p>

<p>A man on crutches, paralysed but not old, his face quivering
like the wing of a wounded bird, approached Fra Domenico
Buonvicino and handed him a parcel.</p>

<p>'What is it,' asked the friar; 'more drawings?'</p>

<p>'A matter of anatomy. Yesterday I forgot to hand it over,
but to-night a voice reproved me: "Sandro," it said, "you have
still some 'vanities and anathemata' in the loft above your
shop." So I got up and hunted for these drawings of nude
bodies.'</p>

<p>The monk took the parcel with a good-natured smile.</p>

<p>'We shall light a famous fire, Ser Filippepi!' he said.</p>

<p>The paralytic looked at the pyramid and heaved a profound
sigh.</p>

<p>'Lord! Lord! have mercy on us miserable sinners! And
to think that but for Fra Girolamo we should be still in our
sins! And even now, who knows if we shall save our souls?'</p>

<p>He crossed himself and murmured prayers, fingering his
rosary.</p>

<p>'Who is that?' Giovanni asked of Fra Domenico.</p>

<p>'Sandro Botticelli,' was the answer, 'son of Ser Mariano
Filippepi, the tanner.'</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>When at last the curtain of night had fallen upon Florence,
a whisper ran through the crowd.</p>

<p>'They come! They come!'</p>

<p>Slowly, silently, without torches, without hymns, the procession
advanced. Before the white-robed troop of the child
inquisitors was borne the waxen image of the child Jesus,
pointing with one hand to his crown of thorns, with the other
blessing the people. After the children came monks, the
clergy of the whole town, the <i>gonfalonieri</i>, the magnificent
gentlemen of the Council of Eighty; the cathedral canons,
the doctors of theology, the magistrates, the cavaliers, the
guards of the Bargello, the heralds and trumpeters. Upon
reaching the piazza the procession stood still, and a deathly
silence came over the multitude, such as precedes an execution.
Then Savonarola mounted the <i>Ringhiera</i>, a stone platform
before the Palazzo Vecchio, lifted the crucifix, and
commanded in sonorous tones:&mdash;</p>

<p>'In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,
kindle the flame!'</p>

<p>Four monks approached the pyre with torches, and
immediately fire broke out at the four opposing corners.
The flames crackled, and a smoke at first grey, then blackening,
rose in wreaths to heaven. Trumpets sounded, the monks
chanted a canticle in honour of the Lord, and the children
sang in chorus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">'Lumen ad revelationem gentium et gloriam plebis Israel.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The great bell of the Palazzo Vecchio rolled a solemn and
majestic sound upon the air, and was answered from all the
belfries of the town. The fire rose ever fiercer and more
brilliant; and the delicate parchment leaves of the old books
curled up and perished. From the lowest step a bunch of
false hair rose flaming and floated away, amid the jeers and
laughter of the crowd. Among the people were some who
prayed, some who wept; others screamed and danced, and
waved their arms and kerchiefs and caps; others prophesied.</p>

<p>'Sing, brothers, sing unto the Lord a new song!' shouted
a limping shoemaker with wild eyes: 'All the world is
crumbling! burning, burning to a horrible destruction,
even as these vanities in the purifying fire&mdash;all&mdash;all&mdash;all!&mdash;Church,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
laws, governments, powers, arts, learning&mdash;one stone
shall not be left upon another!&mdash;there shall be a new heaven
and a new earth; and God shall wipe away all tears from our
eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor
weeping nor sickness! O Lord Jesus, come! come!'</p>

<p>A young woman, with a thin and suffering face, pregnant,
no doubt the wife of some poverty-stricken artisan, fell on
her knees, spreading her hands towards the flame, as if in
very truth she saw in it a vision of the Christ Himself; then
starting up and calling like one possessed, she cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>'My Jesus! my Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus! Come!'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>X</h3>

<p>Among the objects burning at the stake Giovanni could
not take his eyes off a picture lighted up but not yet touched
by the flame. It was by Leonardo: a shining white Leda,
lying on the waves of a mountain-girdled lake, among the
low-toned reflections of twilight. A great swan spread his
wings over her, bending his long neck, and filling the sky and
the earth with his triumphant hymn of love, while Leda
watched her twin sons. Giovanni stared at the advance of
the flame, his heart beating high in nervous horror.</p>

<p>Just then the monks elevated a sombre cross in the centre
of the square, and in honour of the Trinity made themselves
into three circles, joining their hands; then testifying
to the spiritual joy of the faithful, they danced, first slowly,
then faster and faster, till at last they were as a mighty
whirlwind, and they sang the while:&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>Ognun gridi com' io grido! Sempre pazzo, pazzo, pazzo!</i>'</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Each and all with me cry out,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Unto those things fondly turning</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
The heads of the spectators reeled, and their hands
and feet were set in motion; suddenly children, men,
feeble women joined in the frantic dance. One old and
unwieldy monk, like an aged faun, tripped, fell, and was
hurt so that the blood flowed; he was flung aside, barely
escaping trampling, and the dance rolled on. The fire's
crimson and flickering glow lighted convulsed faces: a vast
shadow was thrown by the crucifix, the moveless centre of
the whirling circles.</p>

<p>At last the creeping flame had reached the Leda, with its
scarlet tongue had licked the pure body, flushed as if living, and
grown momentarily yet more mystic and exquisite. Giovanni
gazed, shuddering and turning pale, and for him Leda smiled
her last smile; then dissolving in the fire, like a cloud in the
sunrise, she was lost for ever.</p>

<p>And now the flame had attained the huge devil on the apex
of the pyramid: its paunch, filled with powder, burst with a
tremendous crash. A pillar of fire rose to the sky. The
monster tottered on his blazing throne, bowed, fell, and was
scattered in a powder of dying embers.</p>

<p>Drums and trumpets sounded. All the bells pealed, the
crowd raised a roar of triumph, as though Satan himself
had perished in the flames of the holy pile, together with all
the falsehood, pain and sins of the whole earth. Giovanni
clapped his hands to his temples and would have fled. But
a hand was laid upon his shoulder; he turned and looked:
beside him stood Leonardo, with his quiet untroubled face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
The Master took him by the hand and drew him forth from
the crowd.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>They moved from the square, pervaded by clouds of
stifling smoke, and, lit up by the glow of the dying bonfire,
by an obscure lane they took their way to the banks of
the Arno. Here all breathed quietness and calm: the stream
glided by, gently murmuring: the stars scintillated, coldly
brilliant, and the moon bathed the hills in a flood of silver
glory.</p>

<p>'Giovanni,' said Leonardo, 'why did you forsake me?'</p>

<p>The disciple raised his eyes and tried to speak; but his
voice died in his throat, his lip trembled, and he burst into
tears.</p>

<p>'Master&mdash;forgive me!'</p>

<p>'You have done me no wrong.'</p>

<p>'I knew not what I did,' murmured Boltraffio. 'How, O
God! how could I have left you?'</p>

<p>He would have told his sufferings, his madness, the anguish
of his terrible doubts. But as when at Milan he had stood
before the Colossus of Francesco Sforza, he felt that Leonardo
would have no comprehension; and in hopeless entreaty he
looked into his eyes&mdash;eyes clear, calm, and alien as the stars.</p>

<p>As if divining the conflict in his soul, the Master did not
question him; he smiled with infinite kindness, and laying his
hand on the young head he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>'God help you, my poor boy: you know I have ever loved
you as my favourite son! Will you come back to me? I
will receive you with joy.'</p>

<p>Then, scarce audibly, as if speaking to himself, he added:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The deeper the sensitiveness, the greater the grief. A
martyr among the martyrs!'</p>

<p>From afar came the clash of the bells, the scream of the
chant, the cry of the frenzied mob. But Master and pupil
were happy.</p>

<p>Beatrice d'Este, Duchess of Milan, sat in her boudoir
writing a letter to her sister Isabella, wife of the Marchese
Francesco Gonzaga, lord of Mantua:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Most excellent madonna and well-beloved Sister, I and <i>il
Signor</i> Ludovico, my spouse, desire your good health, and
that of <i>il Signor</i> Francesco, your illustrious consort.</p>

<p>'In obedience to your desire I send you the portrait of
Massimiliano, my Son, only I pray you not to conceive of him
as of the smallness here indicated. I would send you the
precise measurements of how tall he is, but that I am afraid,
for the nurse tells me such measurement would impede his
growth. He grows <i>amazingly</i>. If I see him not for a couple
of days, I find him so greatly enlarged that I jump for joy.</p>

<p>'Here at court we have a great grief: the little Fool Nannino
hath died. You, my sister, knew him and loved him well;
you will therefore comprehend that while I might have
replaced any other loss, Nature herself could not fill the void
left by Nannino, since in this Being, formed expressly for the
delight of princes, she had united the perfection of imbecility
with the most entrancing hideousness. Bellincioni has composed
a most elegant Elegy, declaring that if Nannino is
in Heaven then all paradise must laugh, if he is in hell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
even Cerberus grinneth. We have buried him, with many
tears, in our family tomb in St. Maria delle Grazie, beside my
favourite falcon, and the memorable bitch Puttina. Death
shall not wholly separate me from so delightful a possession.
I have wept for two entire nights, and Ludovico, my lord,
in the hope to console me, has promised me for a Christmas
gift a magnificent silver bedside Seat, ornamented with a relief
of the fight between the Centaurs and the Lapithæ. Its interior
will be of pure gold, very massive, and it hath a Baldachin
of velvet, embroidered with our ducal arms. A similar
seat has no other prince, neither the Pope, nor the Emperor,
nor the grand Turk. It will excel in beauty that one
famed by Martial in his epigram. My lord, Ludovico,
had wished Leonardo da Vinci to contrive a musical-organ
in its Interior, but he hath excused himself on some
flimsy pretext, such as the finishing of his Colossus, or his
<i>Cenacolo</i>. You prayed me, beloved Sister, to lend you this
Painter for a time. With pleasure would I accede to your
request, and verily not lend but give him to you for ever; but
my lord, Ludovico, for what reason I cannot say, is exceeding
well-disposed toward this man, and would not consent to his
removal for all the gold in the world. Be not disappointed
overmuch, for verily this Leonardo is occupied to such a
degree with alchemy, mechanics, Magic, and other such like
follies, that he scarce attends to his painting; secondly,
he executes all commissions with a slowness that would lose
an Angel his patience; thirdly, he is an infidel.</p>

<p>'Of late we have had a wolf-hunt. They do not permit
me to mount on horseback, for I am now advanced in my
fifth month; but I watched the hunt from the high platform
of a conveyance made expressly for me, in form like a pulpit.
I assure you that in this box I was rather tortured than
diverted. When the Wolf made his escape into the forest
I wept with rage. Had I been upon my horse I swear he
should not thus have got away, though I had broken my
collar-bone.</p>

<p>'My little sister, do you recall how we used to leap our
horses? And how Penthesilea fell in the Ditch and almost
destroyed herself? And the boar-hunt at Cusnago? And
the tennis? and the angling? What fine times were those!</p>

<p>'Here we amuse ourselves as best we can. We play at
cards, and we skate, which is a most pleasing diversion, introduced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
among us by a Flemish gentleman, for the winter is
very severe, and not only the lakes but likewise the rivers
are completely frozen. In the park Leonardo hath built
out of snow a most elegant Leda embraced by the swan.
Pity 'tis that in the spring it will melt!</p>

<p>'And you, delightful sister, how fare you? And has your
breed of cats with long hair succeeded well? If you have a
male Kitten with tawny hair and blue eyes, I pray you to send
him with the young Negress you have promised me; I will
give you in exchange my little bitch's next litter.</p>

<p>'Pray you, do not omit to send the model of the Wrapper
of azure satin, with the cross-cut collar and the trimming of
sables. I asked for it in my last letter. Pray you, despatch
it at once; 'twere best to-morrow at day-break, and by a
mounted messenger. And send me also a vessel of your
boasted ointment for the king's evil, and some of that
foreign wood for the finger-nails.</p>

<p>'Our astrologer predicts a very hot summer, and War.
What saith your prophet? One's faith jumps always with
the astrologer belonging to somebody else.</p>

<p>'I and Ludovico, my lord, commend ourselves to your
gracious remembrance, beloved sister, and that of your
illustrious consort, the Signor Marchese Francesco.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Beatrice Sforza</span>.'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding the frank tone of this letter, it was full of
finished policy. Beatrice concealed from her sister her private
anxieties and annoyances, for, as matter of fact, peace was
very far from reigning between husband and wife. The lady
hated Leonardo neither for heresy nor atheism, but because
he had painted the portrait of Cecilia Bergamini, the Duchess's
most detested rival. Of late, also, she had suspected an
intrigue with one of her ladies, Madonna Lucrezia Crivelli.</p>

<p>At this time Ludovico was at the zenith of his power.
Son of Francesco Sforza&mdash;that daring mercenary from the
Romagna, half soldier, half brigand&mdash;he dreamed of making
himself lord of an united Italy.</p>

<p>'The Pope,' he boasted, 'shall be my chaplain, the
Emperor my captain, Venice my treasury, and the King of
France my courier.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
He signed himself '<i>Ludovicus Maria Sfortia Anglus Dux
Mediolani</i>,' deducing his descent from Anglus the Trojan,
companion of Æneas. The Colossus, monument to his
father Francesco, with the inscription <i>Ecce Deus</i>, was designed
as a testimony to the divine origin of the Sforzas. For
all his external prosperity, however, the Duke was tortured
by anxiety and secret fear. He knew himself unloved by
the people, and reckoned a usurper. Once in the Piazza
dell' Arrengo the people, seeing the widow of Gian Galeazzo
with her eldest son, had shouted, 'Long live Francesco, our
rightful Duke!'</p>

<p>The boy was eight years old, and famed for his intelligence
and beauty. Marin Sanuto, the Venetian, wrote of him:
'The people desire him for their prince, even as they desire
God.' Beatrice and her husband had recognised that the
death of Gian Galeazzo had not been sufficient to make
them lords of Milan, since in this child the shade of his
father was rising from the tomb.</p>

<p>There was talk in the city of mysterious portents. At
night, above the castle towers, a strange glow had appeared
as that of a conflagration. In the palace chambers agonising
groans had been heard. It was remembered that when Gian
Galeazzo had lain dead it had been impossible to shut his
left eye, omen of the imminent death of one of his near kinsmen;
the eyelids of the Madonna dell' Albore had quivered;
outside the Porta Ticinese an old woman's cow had dropped
a double-headed calf. The Duchess herself had seen an
apparition in the Sala della Rocchetta, had fainted with
terror, and refused to discuss it with any one, even her
husband. She had altogether lost that vivacity and grace
which had been so attractive to her spouse, and, filled with
the gloomiest prognostications, was awaiting the approaching
birth of her child.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>III</h3>

<p>On a melancholy December evening, while snowflakes
were slowly falling on the streets of Milan, Il Moro sat in the
little detached apartment of the palace in which he had
installed his new love, Madonna Lucrezia Crivelli. The
flames from the fire on the open hearth lighted up the
polished doors with their inlaid views of the ancient buildings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
in Rome, the moulded and chequered lacework of the
ceiling touched up with gold, the walls covered with Cordovan
leather and gold hangings, the tall black chairs and
settles, the round table, the novel by Boiardo lying open, the
sheets of music, the mother-o'-pearl mandoline, and the
crystal goblet of <i>Balnea aponitana</i>, a spa water, at that time
greatly in fashion. On the wall hung the lady's portrait
painted by Leonardo. Caradosso had carved the marble
reliefs of the chimney-piece&mdash;curled serpents gnawing a vine,
and naked children, half cherubs, half cupids, playing with
the sacred instruments of the Lord's Passion; nails, sponge,
lance, and crown of thorns.</p>

<p>The fierce wind howled in the chimney, but within the
dainty <i>studiolo</i> all was comfort and luxury. Madonna
Lucrezia, seated on a cushion at the Duke's feet, was sorrowful,
for he had chided her, the ground of his complaint being
that she did not visit Beatrice, his duchess.</p>

<p>'Your Excellency!' cried the girl, with drooping eyelids,
'I beseech you, constrain me not! I am incapable of lying.'</p>

<p>'Lying?' echoed Il Moro; 'but this is concealment, not
lying! Did not the Thunderer himself hide his pranks from
his jealous spouse? And Theseus? and Phædra? and
Medea? All the gods and heroes of antiquity! We, poor
mortals, cannot resist the might of the god of Love. But
would it be well to have the evil flagrant? Then you lead
your neighbour into temptation, which is contrary to all
Christian charity. And charity, you know, covers a multitude
of sins.'</p>

<p>He laughed; but Lucrezia shook her head and looked at
him with her large eyes, innocent and pensive as a child's.</p>

<p>'You know, my lord, I am happy in your love; but sometimes
I fall into such a remorse, remembering that I am
deceiving Madonna Beatrice, who loves me as a sister, that I
know not how to endure it.'</p>

<p>'Enough, enough, my child!' cried the Duke, and drew
her to his knee, throwing one arm round her waist, and with
the other hand caressing her smooth raven tresses, which
were confined by the <i>ferroniera</i>, a thread of gold fastened
over the brow by a diamond, which glistened like a tear.
Lowering her eyelashes she permitted his caresses coldly, and
without returning them.</p>

<p>'Ah, if you knew how I loved thee, my gentle one! so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
sweet, so modest! Thee only!' he sighed, breathing again
that odour of violet and musk.</p>

<p>The door opened, and a frightened maid-servant rushed in.</p>

<p>'Madonna! madonna!' she cried; 'there! down by the
great door! O Lord, have pity on us sinners!'</p>

<p>'Speak!' said the Duke, 'who is at the great door?'</p>

<p>'Beatrice, the Duchess.'</p>

<p>Il Moro turned pale.</p>

<p>'The key! Quick, the key of the little door! I will go
through the courtyard. Give me the key&mdash;at once.'</p>

<p>'But the cavaliers of Madonna Beatrice are surrounding
the house!' cried the servant, wringing her hands.</p>

<p>'Then it's a trap,' said the Duke rubbing his brow. But
how has she come by the knowledge? Who can have told
her?'</p>

<p>'Surely Monna Sidonia, the accursed witch who creeps in
to vex us with her unguents and her phials. I warned you,
Madonna, to beware of her.'</p>

<p>'What's to be done? <i>Dio mio!</i> What's to be done?'
muttered the Duke, ever paler.</p>

<p>From the street came a violent knocking on the great door
and the servant rushed to the staircase.</p>

<p>'Hide me, Lucrezia. Hide me!'</p>

<p>'Most Excellent, if Madonna Beatrice suspects, she will
search the house. Were it not better that you went straight
up to her?'</p>

<p>'God forbid! You know not the manner of woman she is.
Good Lord, to think what may come of this! Remember
her state&mdash;the danger to the infant! Hide me; hide me at
once&mdash;no matter where.'</p>

<p>At this moment the Duke more nearly resembled a thief
detected than a descendant of Anglus, the companion of
Æneas.</p>

<p>Lucrezia took him to her dressing-chamber and hid him in
the wardrobe, a large press let into the wall, with white doors
inlaid with gold; here he effaced himself in a corner among
the dresses.</p>

<p>'What a position!' he said to himself. 'Exactly like
the ridiculous heroes of Boccaccio or Sacchetti.'</p>

<p>Il Moro was, however, in no mood to appreciate the ridiculous
side of the adventure. He drew from his bosom a
small case with relics of St. Christopher; another containing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
a morsel of Egyptian mummy, a talisman much in vogue.
In the dark he could not distinguish which was which of
these treasures, so he kissed them both, crossing himself and
praying.</p>

<p>Hearing the voices of his wife and his mistress entering
the closet together, he turned cold with fear. But they were
talking amicably as though nothing were amiss. Lucrezia
was showing the Duchess her new house, at her own
urgent request. Probably Beatrice had no clear proofs of
her case, and therefore was dissembling her suspicion. It
was a duel of feminine cunning.</p>

<p>'What! gowns here, too?' said the Duchess indifferently,
as she approached the press in which her husband had settled
himself down half dead with fear.</p>

<p>'Yes, old gowns. What I wear at home. Would your
Excellence like to look?' said Lucrezia, also indifferently,
and she partly opened the door.</p>

<p>'Hearken, my dear. Where do you keep that robe I was
so fond of&mdash;don't you remember?&mdash;which you wore at
the Pallavicini fête last summer? Little golden caterpillars
sparking like fireflies on a purple ground.'</p>

<p>'I don't remember,' said Lucrezia. 'Oh, yes, though&mdash;it
must be here,' and she moved away from her lover's hiding-place,
leaving its door ajar, and drew the Duchess to the other
wardrobe.</p>

<p>'And she declared she could not deceive!' thought the
duke, pleased notwithstanding his terror. 'What presence of
mind! Oh, women! 'tis from you princes should learn
diplomacy.'</p>

<p>Presently the ladies moved away into the adjoining apartment,
and Il Moro breathed more freely, though he still
convulsively clutched at the relics of St. Christopher and the
morsel of mummy.</p>

<p>'Two hundred imperial ducats to the monastery of St.
Maria delle Grazie for oil and candles, if it ends well!' he
vowed.</p>

<p>At last the maid came running, opened the press, and
with an air both respectful and sly let the prisoner out, telling
him the danger was passed, and the most excellent Madonna
Beatrice had been pleased to retire, after taking a gracious
leave of Madonna Lucrezia.</p>

<p>Having crossed himself, he returned to the <i>studiolo</i>, drank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
a glass of the <i>Balnea aponitana</i> water, looked at Lucrezia, who
sat by the fireplace as before, her head drooping, and smiled.
Then he stepped cautiously to her side, bent down and took
her in his arms. The girl shuddered.</p>

<p>'Leave me! Leave me, I pray you. I beseech you to go
away. How can you do this after what has happened?'</p>

<p>But the Duke unheeding, covered her face and neck and
hair with ardent kisses. He had found a new charm in her
unsuspected talent for deception, and never had she seemed
to him more lovely.</p>

<p>The December storm still howled in the chimney; but the
glow of the fire illuminated the chain of laughing naked
children who, among the vine-branches of Bacchus brandished
nail, hammer, spear, and crown of thorns.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>For three months, under the direction of Bramante,
Caradosso, and Leonardo da Vinci, preparation had been
making for the great ball, decreed by the Duke for New Year's
Day. No less than two thousand persons had been invited.
On the appointed day, at about five o'clock in the afternoon,
the guests assembled at the palace. A snowstorm had damaged
the roads; the castle towers and battlemented walls with the
loop-holes for the mouths of cannon showed with ghastly whiteness
against the heavy clouds. Fires had been kindled in the
wide courtyard, and round these were assembled noisy groups
of equerries, palanquin-bearers, grooms, couriers, outriders,
and their like. Gilded chariots and coaches, very cumbrous,
and drawn by cart-horses, were setting down fur-wrapped
ladies and cavaliers at the entrance of the palace, or crossing
the drawbridge which led to the inner court of the Rocchetta.
The frosted windows glittered in the festal illuminations
within.</p>

<p>Entering the vestibule, the guests passed between two
long rows of ducal guards, Turkish <i>mamelukes</i>, Greek <i>stradiotes</i>,
Scotch bowmen, Swiss <i>lanzknechts</i>, all in armour,
and bearing heavy halberts. In front of them stood the
pages, pretty as maidens, in parti-coloured liveries, the
right side pink velvet, the left blue satin, trimmed with
swan's-down, and silver-embroidered with the arms of Sforza
and Visconti. Their garments were so tight as to display
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
every outline of their lithe and graceful bodies; and in their
hands these charming candlebearers held torches of red and
yellow wax, such as were used in the churches. As each
guest entered the great hall, a herald, attended by two
trumpeters, proclaimed his style and titles; then a vista
opened before him of vast dazzlingly-lighted saloons: 'the
hall of the white doves on a red field'; 'the hall of gold,'
with the ducal hunting trophies; 'the hall of purple,' hung
with gold-embroidered purple satin, adorned with buckets and
firebrands (the insignia of the Dukes of Milan, who at pleasure
could blow up the fire of war, or quench it with the waters of
peace). Last was the small and exquisite 'black saloon,'
designed by Bramante, and adorned on walls and ceiling with
frescoes by Leonardo, still unfinished.</p>

<p>The richly-dressed crowd buzzed like a swarm of bees.
Their attire was iridescent, gorgeous, not seldom tasteless
through over-richness, in fashions borrowed from many
lands, so that a witty writer of the day said that he
read the invasion of foreigners, and the enslavement of
Italy, in the garb of his own countrymen. The robes of
the ladies, hanging in heavy folds, and stiff with gold and
jewels, suggested ecclesiastical vestments. Many were heirlooms
handed down from long-forgotten grandmothers. There
was ample display of fair shoulders and bosoms, and hair was
confined in golden nets, and plaited in thick strands, artificially
lengthened by ribbons and false hair. Fashion
proscribed eyebrows; therefore ladies whom nature had disfigured
by those superfluities carefully removed them, hair by
hair, with steel tweezers called '<i>pelatoio</i>.' Rouge, and heavy
perfumes such as musk, amber, viverra, and cypress powder,
were regarded as mere necessary decencies.</p>

<p>Here and there in the crowd might be seen girls and
women inheritors of that peculiar charm only seen in
Lombardy, that beauty, as it were, of vaporous shadows,
melting like mist into the transparent pallor of the skin;
of oval faces, and delicate chiselling of features such as
Leonardo delighted to paint.</p>

<p>Madonna Violante Borromeo was by universal consent
acclaimed queen of the festival, with her black and brilliant
eyes, her tresses dark as night, her triumphant beauty patent
to all. Her dress was embroidered with moths burning
their wings in flames&mdash;a warning to all heedless admirers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Yet it was not Madonna Violante who attracted the eyes of
veritable connoisseurs in female loveliness so much as the
graceful Diana Pallavicino. Her eyes were clear and cold as
ice, her fair hair was almost colourless, her smile calm,
her voice slow, melodious, and thrilling as the strings of a viol.
She wore a simple dress of white damask with long floating
lines, trimmed with ribbons of palest green: amid the noise
and splendour of the feast she seemed a being apart, alien,
solitary, like a water-lily slumbering on some silent moonlit
pool.</p>

<p>Suddenly the horns and trumpets sounded, and all the
guests moved to the great Hall of the Tennis Court. Here
waxlights burned in fiery clusters upon huge candelabra,
and woke sparkles in the golden stars which strewed the
azure ceiling-vault. The balcony, in which the choir was
concealed, was hung with silken carpets, and with garlands
of evergreens.</p>

<p>Punctual to the moment prescribed by the astrologers
(for the Duke never moved a step nor, as the wits had it,
changed his shirt nor kissed his wife, without first consulting
the stars), Il Moro and Beatrice made their entry, robed in
ermine-lined brocaded mantles, followed by pages, chamberlains,
and lords-in-waiting. On the breast of the Duke, set as
a brooch, glowed a ruby of extraordinary brilliance and size,
taken from the treasure of Gian Galeazzo.</p>

<p>As for Beatrice, she had of late greatly declined in beauty;
her unformed still girlish expression and manner had a
strange pathos, contrasted with the state of her health and
evident sufferings.</p>

<p>The Duke gave the signal, the seneschal raised his staff, the
music struck up, and the guests took their allotted seats at
the splendid banquet.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>V</h3>

<p>And now a commotion arose. The ambassador of the
Grand Duke of Muscovy, Danilo Mamiroff, refused to sit
below the envoy of the Most Serene Republic of St. Mark.
To all explanations, persuasions and entreaties the old man
was obstinate, and only repeated:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I will not sit down. I will not sit down. 'Tis an affront!'
Nor recked he of curious looks and ironical smiles turned on
him from every side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
'What's the matter? More trouble with the Muscovites?
Good Lord, what barbarians they show themselves! They
always expect the best places, and won't listen to reason.
They are for ever in the way. Mere savages! And such a
language! They might as well be Turks! A nation of wild
beasts!'</p>

<p>Messer Boccalino, the interpreter, a Mantuan of great
resource, hurried to the ambassador:&mdash;</p>

<p>'But Messer Daniele, Messer Daniele!' he cried in broken
Russian, bowing low, and making gestures of perfect servility,
'Messer Daniele, you really must sit! 'Tis a mere Milanese
custom. Sit down, I beseech you, or his Highness will be
offended.'</p>

<p>Nikita Karachiarov, Mamiroff's young secretary, had come
likewise to the old man.</p>

<p>'Danilo Kusmitch, little father, do not, I pray you, be
wroth. No one can keep his own rule in a strange monastery!
What would you have? These foreigners are ignorant of our
usages. Pray you beware lest they take you by the arms and
exclude you from the banquet. Think what a figure we
should cut!'</p>

<p>'Nikita, hold your tongue. 'Tis not for you to teach a man
of my years. I know very well what I am about. I am not
going to give in. I will never sit below that man from Venice.
I represent my sovereign; and my sovereign is the Autocrat
of all the Russias....'</p>

<p>'Messer Daniele! Messer Daniele!' stammered Boccalino.</p>

<p>'Leave me alone, you monkey-face. What are you squeaking
about? Get away. I have said I will not sit down, and
sit down I will not!'</p>

<p>The old man's small eyes, gleaming like those of a bear
under his frowning brows, flashed fires of pride, fury, and
indomitable obstinacy. His emerald-studded staff trembled
in the tight grasp of his nervous fingers. It was clear that
he was not to be subdued by any human force. The Duke
summoned the Venetian envoy, and with that happy
courtesy which was his characteristic, he begged as a personal
favour to himself that the Italian guest would consent to the
change in his seat. He added that no one attached the
slightest importance to the childish arrogance of these utter
barbarians. Yet in point of fact Ludovico greatly prized the
favour of the Grand Duke of Muscovy; he reckoned on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
countenance to conclude an advantageous treaty with the
Sultan. The Venetian looked at Mamiroff, contemptuously
shrugged his shoulders, remarked that his Excellency spoke
well, and quarrels over precedence were unworthy of educated
persons; then calmly seated himself in the chair
allotted. Danilo Kusmitch had not understood the conversation,
nor would it have altered his sense of his own
importance. Unconcerned at the fire of hostile eyes, complacently
stroking his beard and adjusting the sash and the
sable-trimmed satin pelisse upon his corpulent person, Danilo
seated himself heavily and majestically upon the chair he had
conquered; while Nikita and Boccalino retired to the lower
table, and sat beside Leonardo da Vinci.</p>

<p>The boastful Mantuan told tales, half fact, half fiction, of
the wonders he had seen in Muscovy; but Leonardo, desiring
more dependable information about the far-off land which,
like all things vast and mysterious, excited his immediate
interest, addressed himself to Karachiarov, asking questions
about its boundless plains, its immense rivers and forests, the
flood-tide in its Hyperborean ocean and its Hyrcanian sea,
the sunlit northern nights; finally about certain of his
friends who had gone thither&mdash;Pietro Solari, who was engaged
in the building of the Granite Palace in Moscow, and Fioravanti
of Bologna, who was putting up certain fine edifices in
the square of the Kremlin.</p>

<p>'Messere,' said the lovely Madonna Ermellina to the
interpreter at her side, 'I have heard that astonishing
country of which you speak called "Rossia" because of its
wondrous abounding in roses. Pray you, is this to be
credited?'</p>

<p>Boccalino laughed, and assured her that in 'Rossia' there
was, on the contrary, sad lack of the queen of flowers, on
account of the intolerable cold; and he told the following
tale:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Certain Florentine merchants once went to Poland, but
were not allowed further into 'Rossia' because of the state
of war between Poland and the Grand Duke of Muscovy.
The Florentines, desirous of buying sables, invited Russian
merchants to the bank of the Borysthenes, which flowed
between the two countries; and bargaining began across the
river, each party shouting their loudest. But so great was
the cold that the words froze in the air and reached not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
opposite bank. Certain ingenious peasants then made a
huge fire on the midmost point of the ice-bound river; and
presently, lo! the words which had remained a whole hour
in mid-river air unable to move, began to thaw and to drip,
gurgling and clattering like the droppings in the melting time
of spring; and at last they were distinctly heard on the far
shore by the Florentines, notwithstanding the fact that the
Muscovites who had uttered them had long since left the
opposite bank.'</p>

<p>After listening to this anecdote, the ladies looked with
great compassion at Nikita, the inhabitant of so unpleasing a
country. Nikita, however, did not respond to their glances, for
his attention had been arrested by a wondrous dish just
served; a naked Andromeda, made of the breasts of capons,
bound to a rock of cream-cheese, and about to be loosed by
a winged Perseus of veal.</p>

<p>The meat courses had all been served on plates of gold,
but the fish was eaten off silver, as more appropriate to the
watery element; silvered bread and silvered lemons were
handed round, and then among oysters, lampreys, and trout
appeared Amphitrite herself, made of the white flesh of eels,
riding in a mother-o'-pearl chariot drawn by dolphins over an
ocean of quivering blue jelly.</p>

<p>After this came the sweets, marchpane, pistachios, cedar-cones,
almonds, and burnt sugar, edifices designed by
Bramante and Leonardo&mdash;Hercules in the garden of the
Hesperides, Hippolytus and Phædra, Bacchus and Ariadne,
Danae and Zeus&mdash;a whole Olympus of resuscitated gods.</p>

<p>Nikita stared with childish enjoyment, but Danilo was so
much shocked that he lost his appetite, and growled between
his teeth&mdash;</p>

<p>'Antichristian abominations! Horrible paganism! Horrible!'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Dancing began; slow and stately measures known as
'Venus and Zephyr,' 'Cruel Destiny,' 'Cupid,' etc.; the
dresses of the ladies, being long and heavy, did not admit of
rapid motion. The music was tender and soft, full of passionate
languor like the sonnets of Petrarch, and to it moved
dames and cavaliers, meeting and parting with bows, sighs,
and smiles, all the perfection of dignity and grace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Messer Galeazzo Sanseverino, the young commandant of
Il Moro's guards, was the cynosure of the ladies' eyes; he
was attired in white, with open-work sleeves upon a pink
lining; his white shoes had diamond buckles, and his face
was handsome, but fatigued, dissipated, and effeminate. An
approving murmur ran through the crowd when in the dance,
'<i>Sorte crudele</i>' he dropped (of course accidentally), first his
shoe, and then his mantle, but continued gliding and circling
with that air of saddened negligence which was considered
the mark of breeding. Danilo Mamiroff watched him in
astonishment, spat contemptuously, and exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'Good Lord, what a fool!'</p>

<p>The Duchess was not dancing; her heart was heavy, and
only long practice enabled her to play her part of amiable
hostess, to receive the New-Year's congratulations, and to
respond with suitable banalities to the fine speeches of
the courtiers. At times she felt unable to carry the business
through; she longed to escape into some corner where she
could burst into sobs.</p>

<p>Presently she entered a small and secluded apartment,
where by a fire certain young ladies and courtiers were talking
in a close ring. She asked them of what they spoke.</p>

<p>'Of platonic love, your Excellency,' replied one of the
ladies. 'Messer Antoniotto Fregoso maintains that a lady
does no violence to her modesty by kissing a man on the lips
so it be by the way of ideal love.'</p>

<p>'And how does he prove that?' asked the Duchess absently.</p>

<p>Messer Antoniotto answered eagerly himself.</p>

<p>'With your Grace's permission, I maintain that the lips
are the gates of the soul, and when they meet in a platonic
salutation the souls of the lovers rise as to their natural
outlet. Plato condemns not a kiss; and Solomon, in the
Song of Songs, typifying the mystical union of the soul
with God, says, "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his
mouth."'</p>

<p>An old baron, a country knight, with a blunt and honest
face, objected from the point of view of a husband; but the
pretty lady, Fiordiligi, shrugging her graceful bare shoulders,
reproved his barbarism.</p>

<p>'<i>Dio mio!</i> we speak of love, not of marriage! Would you
profane the sacred names "Lover" and "Beloved" with those
ignoble, rude, shameless titles, "husband" and "wife"?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
The baron would have answered her, but Messer Antoniotto
interrupted with further descant; the Duchess, however, was
tired, and moved away.</p>

<p>In the next saloon, verses were being recited by a noted poet
from Rome, Serafino d'Aquila, surnamed the Unique; a little
man very carefully washed, shaved, curled, and scented, with
pink cheeks and a languishing smile, irregular teeth, and wily
eyes.</p>

<p>Seeing Lucrezia in the circle of ladies surrounding this
servant of the Muses, Beatrice paled, but instantly recovering
herself, she advanced and kissed her with her usual graciousness.
Before she could speak, however, an interruption
occurred in the entry of a stout and gorgeous lady, who was
suffering from bleeding of the nose.</p>

<p>''Tis an event upon which even Messer Unico himself could
scarce make love-verses,' observed one of the courtiers contemptuously,
for the sufferer was old and ugly.</p>

<p>Messer Unico, feeling his reputation at stake, sprang to
his feet, passed his hand through his hair, threw back his
head, and raised his eyes to heaven.</p>

<p>'Hush! hush!' murmured the ladies. 'Messer Unico
composes! If your Excellency would move a little further
she would hear better!'</p>

<p>Madonna Ermellina took a lute and ran her fingers over
the strings; thus softly accompanied, the poet, in a voice
guttural and majestic as that of a ventriloquist, declaimed his
lines. They were to the effect that Love, moved by a lover
to shoot at the heart of a fair one, had, owing to the bandage
over his eyes, shot awry, and wounded not the heart but the
nose of the unfortunate lady.</p>

<p>The audience applauded.</p>

<p>'Most beautiful! Stupendous! Unsurpassable! What conceits!
What facility! Not like our Bellincioni who melts
away under the exertion of putting a sonnet together! Truly,
when he raised his eyes I felt the very wind of his inspiration
making me wellnigh afraid!'</p>

<p>One lady offered him wine, another cooling tablets of mint;
another placed him in an armchair and fanned him. He
drooped and languished and blinked his eyes like a gorged
cat in the afternoon sunshine.</p>

<p>Then he produced another sonnet in praise of the Duchess,
which told how the snow, put to shame by the whiteness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
her skin, had in vengeance turned itself to ice, and caused her
to slip and wellnigh to fall upon the courtyard pavement.</p>

<p>Then he celebrated a lady who had lost a front tooth; 'twas
the device of Love, who, dwelling in her mouth, required a
loophole for the shooting of his arrows.</p>

<p>'But this man is a genius!' cried the ladies; 'his name will
go down to posterity linked with that of Dante!'</p>

<p>'Nay, higher than Dante's. Where in the verses of Dante
will you find these subtleties of our Unique one?'</p>

<p>'Ladies,' said the poet humbly, 'methinks you go too far.
Dante has his special merits. Every one has his own
qualities! As for me, I would give Dante's glory for your
applause.'</p>

<p>He began another sonnet; but the Duchess had lost
patience, and went away.</p>

<p>Returning to the main saloon, she commanded her
page, Ricciardetto, a faithful lad, enamoured of her she
sometimes fancied, to attend with a torch at the door of
her bedchamber. Then she hurried through the long line of
brilliant and crowded rooms, passed along a distant and
deserted gallery, and ascended the winding stair. The
immense vaulted apartment, now used as the ducal bedchamber,
lay in the rectangular northern tower of the castle;
she entered, took a candle, and went to a small oaken cupboard
let into the thickness of the wall, in which the Duke
kept important papers and his private letters. She had stolen
the key from her husband, and now, nervous and agitated,
fitted it to the lock. However, the attempt showed
the lock to be broken, and she tore open the brass fastenings,
only to find that the shelves had been emptied of
their contents. Obviously Il Moro, noting the loss of his
key, had transported his letters elsewhere. Beatrice stood
motionless.</p>

<p>Snowflakes were fleeting past the window like white
phantoms. The wind whistled, and howled, and moaned,
and the lady shuddered as she listened, for these voices of
the storm and of the night recalled to her mind a something
terrible which she was never able to forget for long.</p>

<p>Her eye fell on the round lid of iron which covered
the aperture to the Dionysius ear, the hearing-tube which
Leonardo had run from the lower chambers of the palace to
the Duke's bedchamber. She put her ear to it now and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
listened. Waves of sound reached her like the rolling of
the sea heard in shells. She listened to the festal cries of
the company, the laughter, the revels, the passionate sighing
of the music, but with it mingled the whistle and roar of
the storm.</p>

<p>Suddenly it seemed to her that, close by her side, some one
murmured 'Bellincioni! Bellincioni!'</p>

<p>She gave a cry, the colour leaving her cheeks.</p>

<p>'Bellincioni! Of course! Why did I never think of him
before? He is the one who will tell me everything. I must
go to him this minute. Only so that no one shall notice me!
Yet, truly, I care not if I am seen. I must <i>know</i>! I can
endure this atmosphere of deceit no longer.'</p>

<p>She remembered that Bellincioni, on the pretext of indisposition,
had not come to the ball. At this hour he would be
at home, and alone!</p>

<p>So she called Ricciardetto, who was at the door.</p>

<p>'Tell two runners, with a litter, to await me below at the
private gate. Despatch. Only see, if you desire my favour,
that the matter is not known. Hear you? It must be
known to none.'</p>

<p>He kissed her hand and set off with the message.</p>

<p>Beatrice threw on a sable pelisse and a mask of black
velvet. A few minutes more and she was in the litter, being
carried toward the Porta Ticinese, where the court poet had
his lodging.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Bernardo Bellincioni called his old ruinous house 'the
lizard's hole.' He was the recipient of many munificent
gifts, but his life was irregular; he drank, and gambled
away whatever he had, so that 'misery,' as he was accustomed
to say, 'followed him like a wife, unloved and faithful.'</p>

<p>Lying on a broken couch, of which the fourth leg was
replaced by a billet of wood, and the mattress thin as a
girdle-cake, he was sipping his third glass of sour wine, and
composing an epitaph for Madonna Cecilia's deceased lapdog.
Listening to the north wind, and making gloomy prognostications
as to the sort of night he was going to spend, he
watched the dying-out of the remnant of fire, and vainly tried
to warm his thin legs in the moth-eaten squirrel cloak, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
he had thrown over them. He had not presented himself at
the court ball (where his masque, <i>Paradiso</i>, was to be performed)
for other reasons than illness; though indeed he had
been ill for some while, and was so lean that, as he said, 'in
his body it were possible to study the anatomy of the bones,
muscles, and veins of the human subject.' Had he been
dying he might still have dragged himself to the festival;
more potent than illness was, however, jealousy; he preferred
freezing in his kennel to witnessing the triumph of his rival,
that interloping and pretentious humbug, Messer Unico,
who had turned the heads of all the silly women. The
mere thought of Messer Unico overflowed his heart with
black bile; he clenched his fist, gnashed his teeth, and
jumped frantically from his bed. But the room was so cold
that he returned to its inadequate shelter, coughed, shivered,
and rolled angrily from side to side.</p>

<p>'The villains!' he grumbled; 'have I not written four
sonnets in the best rhyme praying for firewood, and not a
stick has come. I shall certainly be reduced to burning my
banisters: no one comes to visit me save Jews, and if they
break their necks so much the better.'</p>

<p>However, he spared the banisters. His eye fell on the
makeshift leg of his bed, and he considered which were the
more dangerous, a fireless room or an insecure sleeping-place.
The storm swept through the room, blowing in at the chinks
and shrieking in the chimney like a witch. With desperate
decision Bernardo tore away the support of his couch,
chopped it up and cast it on the hearth. The fire blazed up
anew, and he sat before it on a stool, putting his blue fingers
to the flame, and apostrophising the last warm friend of a
lonely poet.</p>

<p>'A dog's life!' he muttered presently; 'and of a truth I
merit these castigations less than others. Was it not of my
forefather, the Florentine, who lived before the house of
Sforza had been heard of, that the divine poet wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Bellincion Berti vid' io andar cinto</p>
<p>&nbsp; Di cuoio e d'osso"?</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Good Lord, when I came to Milan this herd of creeping
animals did not know a sonnet from a <i>strambotto</i>. Who is it
has taught them the elegancies of the new poetry? Was it not
through my facile fingers that the waters of Hippocrene
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
enriched the Lombard plain, and even threatened an inundation?
And this is my reward! To lie like a dog in a
kennel! To be neglected by all because, forsooth, I am poor!
A poet situated as I am, is unknown as he whose face is
hidden by a mask or deformed by the smallpox.'</p>

<p>And he recited certain lines from his epistle to Ludovico,
the Duke:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'I cry for aid to every one,</p>
<p>&nbsp;But each in turn replies, "Begone!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;Ah, wretched poet! for his pains,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thou generous lord, what meed remains?</p>
<p>&nbsp;The very cap and bells to him denied,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Among the beasts of burden harness thou his pride!'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>And he hung his bald head, smiling bitterly; on his stool
by the fire, crouching, and very thin, with a long red nose,
he looked like some melancholy roosting bird.</p>

<p>Presently a knock was heard at the house-door below; then
the sleepy grumbling of the surly old woman who was the
poet's sole attendant; and then steps upon the brick floor.</p>

<p>'What, the fiend!' wondered Bellincioni; 'can it be that
abominable Jew come again after his money? The infidel
hound! Can he not leave me in peace even at night?'</p>

<p>The staircase creaked, the door opened, and into the
wretched room came a woman in a sable mantle and a black
velvet mask. Astounded and staring, Bernardo sprang to his
feet. The lady, without a word, was about to seat herself
on a chair.</p>

<p>'For God's love, be careful, madam!' cried the poet, 'the
back is broken!' Then in the ceremonious tone of a
courtier he added: 'To what good genius am I indebted for
the happiness of seeing an illustrious lady in my poor
abode?'</p>

<p>'Surely,' he thought, ''tis a customer come to order a
madrigal! Well, it brings money, and that brings firewood!
Yet the hour is strange for a lonely lady! 'Tis clear my name
is not unknown. And if this one, who knows how many
more are my admirers?'</p>

<p>With reviving spirits he threw the rest of the wood on the
flame, which already had begun to languish.</p>

<p>The fair unknown raised her mask.</p>

<p>'It is I, Bernardo.'</p>

<p>In his astonishment he staggered against the doorpost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
'Jesus! Holy Virgin! Angels and martyrs!' he
exclaimed. 'What? Your Excellency! Most shining
lady&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Bernardo, you can do me a great service,' she looked
round uneasily; 'but can any one hear us?'</p>

<p>'Be at ease, madam. No one except the rats and the
mice.'</p>

<p>'Listen!' said Beatrice slowly, fixing her piercing eyes on
his. 'I am aware that you have composed verses for
Madonna Lucrezia; doubtless you have kept the letter of
commission from the Duke.'</p>

<p>He turned pale, and observed her silently, consternation
in his eyes.</p>

<p>'Fear nothing,' she continued; 'no one shall know. I
shall study how to reward you, Bernardo.'</p>

<p>'Your Excellency!' stammered the unlucky poet, whose
tongue had lost its glibness, 'do not believe&mdash;nay, 'tis all
calumny! No letters&mdash;before God, I swear there are no
letters!'</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed, and her brows contracted in an ominous
frown. She rose and drew nearer, still fixing him with her
gaze.</p>

<p>'Lie not. I know all. As you value your life, give me
the Duke's letters. Give me them! Hear you? Bernardo,
be careful, my servants are at the door. Think you I have
come to jest with you?'</p>

<p>He fell before her on his knees.</p>

<p>'But, most illustrious lady, I have no letters!'</p>

<p>'You say you have no letters?'</p>

<p>'None.'</p>

<p>Fury overcame her. 'Wait then, accursed pander, till
I tear the truth from your lips. Oh, I'll wring confession
from you! I'll strangle you with my own hands, you
rubbish, you rogue!' she cried: in good sooth driving her
slender fingers into his throat with such force that the
veins swelled on his forehead. Unresisting, rolling his eyes
and hanging his hands helplessly, he more than ever
resembled a sick bird.</p>

<p>'She is strangling me!' thought Bellincioni; 'well, it can't
be helped. Not for so poor a reason will I betray my lord!'</p>

<p>Dissipated rascal, and venal flatterer the poetaster had
always been, but never traitor. In his veins flowed better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
blood than that of the Sforzas, and the moment had come for
showing it.</p>

<p>The Duchess, however, recovered herself. With a gesture
of disgust she flung him from her, snatched up the little lamp
with its broken sides and charred wick, and made for the
adjoining cabinet, which she guessed to be the poet's working
<i>studiolo</i>. Bernardo, placing himself against the door, barred
the entrance. But the haughty glance of the Duchess awed
him, and he withdrew. She swept past and entered the poor
refuge of his threadbare muse. A smell of mould came
from the books, great patches of damp showed on the plaster
walls. The broken glass of the frosted windows was repaired
with tow. On the sloping ink-splashed board were quills,
gnawed and twisted in the agony of finding rhymes, and
papers, doubtless rough copies of poems.</p>

<p>Heedless of the author, Beatrice stood the lamp on a shelf
and began to rummage among these sheets. She found
sonnets addressed to chamberlains, treasurers, and dispensers,
with burlesque complaints and prayers for firewood, clothes,
wine, and bread. In one he asked of Messer Pallavicini
a roast goose for the due celebration of All Saints' Day. In
another, headed '<i>Del Moro a Cecilia</i>,' the poet recounted
how Jupiter, returning from his mistress, had been forced to
brave the storm lest <i>jealous Juno</i> should guess his treachery,
and tearing the diadem from her brow scatter its pearls like
hailstones and raindrops from the sky.</p>

<p>Presently the search brought the Duchess to a dainty case
of black wood; she opened it, and saw a carefully tied-up
packet of letters. Bernardo, watching her, wrung his hands
in dismay. The Duchess looked at him, then at the letters;
read the name of Lucrezia, recognised the handwriting of her
husband, and knew she had found the thing she sought,
his letters&mdash;the rough draft of the love-verses he had commanded
for Lucrezia. She thrust the packet into the bosom
of her dress, flung a bag of ducats at the poet, as one might
fling a bone to a dog, and departed.</p>

<p>He heard her descend the stair, heard the bang of the
door, and stood motionless in the centre of the room as if
thunderstruck, though the floor seemed shaking under him
like the deck of a ship in storm. At last, exhausted, he flung
himself on the three-legged couch, and sank into a deathlike
slumber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The Duchess returned to the castle, where the guests had
noticed her absence with surprise, and the Duke himself
become alarmed. He met her in the hall, and she accosted
him, her face somewhat blanched, and explained that having
felt fatigued after the banquet she had gone into an inner
room to snatch some repose.</p>

<p>'Bice!' cried the Duke, taking her hand, which was
trembling and cold, 'you are ill! Tell me, for pity's sake,
what is the matter. Shall we put off the second part of this
entertainment? Dear one, did I not arrange it solely to give
pleasure to thee?'</p>

<p>'There is nothing the matter,' replied Beatrice. 'Why
this anxiety, Vico? I have not felt so well this many a day.
I wish to see the <i>Paradiso</i>. I intend to dance.'</p>

<p>Il Moro was partly reassured.</p>

<p>'God be thanked, beloved,' he said, kissing her hand.</p>

<p>The guests now streamed into the <i>Sala del giuoco alla
palla</i>, which had been arranged for the representation of the
<i>Paradiso</i>, by Leonardo da Vinci, the court mechanician.
When every one was seated, and the lights had been extinguished,
it was his voice which cried 'Ready!' Then a
train of powder exploded, and crystalline globes, like planets,
were seen disposed in a circle, filled with water, and
illumined by a myriad of living fires sparkling with rainbow
colours.</p>

<p>'See!' said the lively Madonna Ermellina, pointing out
Leonardo to her neighbour; 'see that face! He is a wizard
capable of carrying away the castle bodily, as one reads in the
romances.'</p>

<p>'I mislike this playing with fire,' replied the other.
'Heaven grant we have not a real fire presently!'</p>

<p>Presently, from a black chest concealed behind the fiery
globes, a white-winged angel arose and recited the prologue.
At the line&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">'The great King makes his spheres revolve'&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>he pointed to the Duke, as if indicating that he governed his
people with the same wisdom shown by the monarch of
heaven in turning his celestial spheres. At the same moment
the crystal globes began to turn to the accompaniment of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
low strange music, representing the celestial harmony told
of by Pythagoras. Again the planets stood still; upon each
appeared its presiding deity, and each one recited a hymn in
praise of Beatrice.</p>

<p>Mercury said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Thou Nature's miracle! Diviner Sun!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Lightning, by whom the clouds are overrun!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thou Lamp, by whom the stars are all outshone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;The pride and glory of a future race!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>&nbsp;In that angelic figure, half concealed,</p>
<p>&nbsp;The secret of the higher world lies sealed,</p>
<p>&nbsp;And all of heaven's glory is revealed</p>
<p class="i4">In that fair face.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>And again Venus, kneeling before the Duchess, exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'O Jove! whose justice never errs,</p>
<p>&nbsp;And at whose voice all nature stirs</p>
<p>&nbsp;And quickens to a goodly heritage,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I bless thee for thy coming unto earth,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Since thus fair Beatrice was given birth,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Whose fruit is nurtured by the Hesperides,</p>
<p>&nbsp;My beauty at her feet in ashes lies,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Despoilèd Venus none shall recognise.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>And Diana prayed that she might be given as a slave to
Beatrice the beauteous, since never had a star like her
shone in the heavenly firmament. Then came the epilogue,
in which Jove presented to Beatrice the three Hellenic
graces and the seven Christian virtues; and the whole
Olympus and Paradise, under the shadow of the radiant
angelic plumes, and of a cross gleaming with green lamps,
symbols of hope, once more began to revolve, while gods and
goddesses sang hymns in praise of Beatrice, accompanied by
the music of the spheres and by the acclamations of the
spectators.</p>

<p>'And why,' asked the Duchess of Messer Gaspare Visconti
who sat at her side; 'why is there here no jealous Juno to
tear the diadem from her brow, and to rain pearls upon the
earth in the form of hailstones and raindrops?'</p>

<p>On hearing these words Il Moro turned quickly and
looked at her. She laughed a laugh so wild and forced that
the Duke felt ice fall round his heart; but immediately
Beatrice composed herself, and turned the conversation;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
Only she pressed the incriminating letters more closely to her
bosom, intoxicated by the hope of revenge, strong, calm,
almost gay, in her mood of triumph.</p>

<p>The masque ended, the guests passed into another hall
where a new spectacle awaited them. The triumphant
chariots of Numa Pompilius, Cæsar, Augustus, and Trajan
crossed the stage, drawn by negroes, leopards, griffons,
centaurs, dragons, and adorned with allegorical pictures and
inscriptions, which set forth that all these heroes were but
precursors of Ludovico of Milan. Then a chariot came
alone, drawn by unicorns, and bearing an immense globe
representing the earth, upon which was stretched a warrior in
a cuirass of rusty iron; a naked and gilded child, holding a
branch of mulberry (<i>moro</i>) in his hand, issued from a cleft in
the cuirass, to signify the death of the Age of Iron and the
birth of the Age of Gold under the sage rule of Ludovico. To
the delight of the spectators the Golden Age proved to be a
living child; he was, however, in great discomfort from the
plaster of gold which covered his little body, and tears shone
in his frightened eyes. In a tremulous and miserable
voice he whined a <i>canzonetta</i>, praising the Duke, with the
monotonous and lugubrious refrain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">'Tornerà l'età dell' oro,</p>
<p class="i2">&nbsp;Cantiam tutti: "Viva il Moro!"'</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>(The age of gold shall brighten as of yore,</p>
<p>&nbsp;And all exulting sing, 'Long live the Moor.')</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Around the chariot of the Golden Age the dancing was
renewed, and though no one heeded him any longer, the
unhappy golden child still sobbed out his piteous song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Tornerà l'età dell' oro,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Cantiam tutti: "Viva il Moro!"'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Beatrice was dancing with Gaspare Visconti. At times she
laughed and sobbed hysterically, and her throat convulsively
contracted. With unsupportable agony the blood throbbed
at her temples, and a mist rolled before her eyes; yet her
face was calm, and she even smiled.</p>

<p>At the dance's conclusion she again slipped unnoticed from
the revelling crowd, and sought seclusion in her private
apartments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>She went to the retired <i>Torre della Tesoreria</i>, where no
one ever came save the Duke and herself. Taking the
candle from Ricciardetto and bidding him await her at the
entrance, she passed into a lofty hall, dark and cold as a
cellar, sat down, drew forth the packet of letters and was
about to read. But suddenly a strange and eerie gust of
wind swept shrieking round the tower, howled in the chimney,
invaded the room with an icy breath almost extinguishing the
candle. There was a great hush; it seemed to her she could
hear the distant music of the ball, the murmur of voices,
the patter of dancing feet, the sound of iron fetters from
the vaults below, where was the prison.</p>

<p>And at the same moment she felt a presence in the room
with her: there, in the dark angle of the wall, with eyes
fixed upon hers. An anguish of terror seized her soul. She
felt she must not move, must not look. But it was unendurable,
and she did look. He stood there, as once she had
seen him before, a long, long, black figure, blacker than
the investing darkness, his head bent, and shrouded in the
cowl of a monk. She tried to scream, to call Ricciardetto,
but her voice failed. She rose to flee and her legs refused to
support her; she fell on her knees groaning:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Thou? Again? And wherefore?'</p>

<p>He raised his head slowly and threw back the cowl, and
showed the visage of Gian Galeazzo Sforza, <i>the murdered
duke</i>. The face had nothing in it corpse-like, nothing
appalling, and he spoke gently and distinctly:</p>

<p>'Poor thing! Poor woman! Pardon me!'</p>

<p>He made a step towards her, and she felt a freezing and
unearthly cold. She shrieked, and fell unconscious to the
earth.</p>

<p>Ricciardetto heard the cry and ran to her succour. When
he saw his beloved mistress stretched senseless, he too
shrieked, rushed away along the dark galleries, where at long
intervals sentries stood holding dim lanterns, then into the
crowded guest-chambers seeking the Duke, and crying wildly:</p>

<p>'Help! Help!'</p>

<p>It was midnight, and the revelry was at its height. The
modish dance called '<i>Fedeli Amanti</i>' had just begun. In it
lady and cavalier must pass under an arch upon which stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
the Genius of Love blowing a trumpet; at its foot were
judges; and when true lovers approached, the Genius greeted
them with tender strains, and the judges smiled and applauded
and let them pass; but the untrue were hindered, and the
trumpet stunned them with terrible noise, the judges pelted
them with hail of <i>confetti</i>, and the luckless couple, loudly
bemocked, were forced to turn and flee.</p>

<p>The Duke, to sweetest strains like the cooing of doves, had
just made his passage of the arch, when, the crowd parting in
dismay to admit his approach, Ricciardetto hurled himself
at his master, still shrieking his wild, 'Help! Help!'</p>

<p>Ludovico laid a hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>'What is it? What has happened?'</p>

<p>'The Duchess! She is dying! Help!'</p>

<p>'The Duchess is ill? Where? Speak, in the name of
God!' cried the Duke.</p>

<p>'In the <i>Torre della Tesoreria</i>.'</p>

<p>The Duke rushed from the hall, his golden chain rattling,
his hair flying.</p>

<p>The Genius of the arch of true lovers went on blowing his
trumpet, but now the dancers left him and he stopped.
Some had followed the Duke&mdash;in a moment the whole brilliant
throng had scattered like a flock of frightened sheep. The
arch was overthrown and trampled, the trumpeter nearly fell,
was hustled, and sprained his ankle.</p>

<p>Some cried 'Fire!'</p>

<p>'I said it was madness to play with fire,' wailed the lady
who had disapproved Leonardo's rotating planets; and others
fainted.</p>

<p>'Calm yourselves, ladies. There is no fire!' said the
seneschal.</p>

<p>'Then what is it?'</p>

<p>'The Duchess is indisposed.'</p>

<p>'Nay, she is dying! She has been poisoned!'</p>

<p>'Impossible! Her Grace was here but now. She was
dancing!'</p>

<p>'But don't you see? Isabella of Arragon, to avenge her
lord, has with slow poison&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'<i>Oh Dio! Dio!</i>'</p>

<p>But in the next saloon the music continued, for there
nothing was known of the disturbance. The dance 'Venus
and Zephyr' was in progress, the smiling ladies leading their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
cavaliers by golden chains, and when these fell on their
knees with lamentable sighs, placing their feet upon their
necks. But a chamberlain now entered, waving his hand to
the musicians.</p>

<p>'Silence! The Duchess is ill.'</p>

<p>There was an instant hush, save for one viol played by a
deaf and purblind old man, which long continued to pour
forth its plaintive quiverings.</p>

<p>The servants passed through the hall carrying a bed,
long and narrow, with hard stuffing, and bars at sides and
ends, kept from time immemorial in the wardrobes of
the palace, and <i>de rigueur</i> for the birth of the princes of
Milan. Strange and ill-omened seemed this portentous
couch in the midst of the festivity, the lights, the crowds
of gorgeous ladies. They looked from one to the others
mysteriously.</p>

<p>''Tis from a fall or, mayhap, a fright,' said one of mature age.
'She should have swallowed at once the white of an egg in
which were lengths of scarlet silk, cut small.'</p>

<p>From the upper room, meantime, (Ricciardetto being
stationed in the adjoining closet) came such a terrible cry,
that the page seized the arm of one of the women who were
passing with warming-pans, baskets of linen, and so forth,
and cried in an agony:&mdash;</p>

<p>'For God's sake, tell me what is the matter?'</p>

<p>She did not answer, and another, clearly the midwife,
ordered him away.</p>

<p>''Tis no place for boys,' she said sternly.</p>

<p>Yet the door was left ajar for a moment, and looking into
the disordered room he saw the suffering face of her whom
he loved with his hopeless boy's love, her lips parted in a
continuous groan.</p>

<p>He turned pale, and hid his face in his hands.</p>

<p>Beside him chattered a group of gossips each with her
infallible recipe; snake's skin, a bath in a heated cauldron,
decoctions of cochineal and of stag's antlers, the tying of her
husband's <i>berretto</i> round the neck of the patient, and so
forth.</p>

<p>The Duke entered hurriedly and sank upon a chair,
clutching his head with his hands and weeping distractedly.</p>

<p>'Lord God! What torture!' he murmured. 'I cannot
support it! I cannot! Ah Bice! Bice! And 'tis all my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
doing! mine!' Still echoed in his ears the furious cry with
which she had greeted his approach.</p>

<p>'Go away! Go away! Go to your Lucrezia!'</p>

<p>One of the busybodies brought him a pewter plate piled
with meat.</p>

<p>'Your Excellency will be pleased to eat it.'</p>

<p>'Good Lord, what are you giving me?'</p>

<p>'Wolf's flesh. 'Tis of great benefit to the wife in her
labour, if the husband will eat the flesh of wolves.'</p>

<p>The Duke, submissive and self-denying, did his best to
swallow the repulsive black substance, which was so hard
as to stick in his throat, and the old woman gabbled as she
bent over him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">'Our Father which art in Heaven,</p>
<p class="i5">Seven wolves and the mate of one,</p>

<p>Holy, Holy, Holy, in the name of the Trinity, one and eternal.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>She was interrupted by Messer Luigi Marliani, the first of
the court physicians, who came from the sick room, followed
by his colleagues.</p>

<p>'Well? well?' asked Ludovico.</p>

<p>There was a silence; then Messer Luigi spoke.</p>

<p>'Your Excellency, we have done all that is possible. Now
we must put our hope in the clemency of the Lord.'</p>

<p>'No! No!' cried the Duke seizing his hand, 'there
must be some means! It is unendurable! Try something!'</p>

<p>The physicians exchanged glances like augurs, hoping thus
to reassure him. Then Marliani, knitting his brows, said in
Latin to the young doctor beside him:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Three ounces of river snails, with nutmeg and red coral,'</p>

<p>'A bleeding, perhaps?' suggested another, an old man,
with a gentle and diffident face.</p>

<p>'I had thought of it,' said Marliani; 'but Mars is in
Cancer and in the fourth house of the sun. And, further,
to-day's date is an uneven number.'</p>

<p>The old man sighed, shook his head and forbore to urge
his point. Various other loathsome medicaments were proposed,
till the Duke could no longer contain himself. He
turned furiously to the doctors.</p>

<p>'To the devil with all your science!' he exclaimed; 'she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
is dying, do you hear me? She is dying! and you have
nothing better to propose than three ounces of snails and
a plaster of cow's dung! Rascals, charlatans, fools! I will
hang every one of you!'</p>

<p>He paced the room a prey to mortal anguish, listening
to the sufferer's unceasing groans. Suddenly his eye fell on
Leonardo and he drew him aside.</p>

<p>'Listen,' he cried wildly, 'Leonardo, you are master of
great secrets. No, no, deny it not, I <i>know</i>. Ah, my God!
my God!&mdash;that cry! What was I saying? Yes, yes! Help
me, Leonardo! Do something! I would give my soul to
succour her&mdash;even for a short space&mdash;only to still that cry!'</p>

<p>Leonardo would have replied; but the Duke, forgetting
that he had appealed to him, hurried to meet the chaplain
and two monks entering at that moment&mdash;</p>

<p>'At last! God be praised. What have you brought? Ah!
a particle of the remains of St. Ambrose, the belt of St.
Margaret&mdash;is she not the patroness of women in childbed?&mdash;and
a hair of the Blessed Virgin! Ah, how I thank you!
And surely your prayers&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Following the monks he was entering the sick-chamber
when the continual low groaning suddenly gave place to
shrieks so appalling that, stopping his ears, he turned and
fled, passing through the dark galleries like one possessed.
He hurried to the chapel and cast himself on his knees before
the most revered picture.</p>

<p>'Holy Mother of God,' he implored with clasped hands
and streaming eyes, 'I have sinned&mdash;I have sinned horribly&mdash;I
have slain an innocent youth&mdash;my lawful sovereign.
O thou merciful Mediatress, have mercy upon me! Take
my life&mdash;take my soul; but in pity, O Holy Mother, save
Beatrice!'</p>

<p>Shreds of thoughts and senseless fancies crowded in his
brain and stole his attention from his prayers. He remembered
a story of a drowning sailor who had thought to buy
salvation by the promise of a candle as big as the mast of
a ship; and when asked how the wax for this colossus was
to be provided, had answered: 'Hold your tongue; our
present task is to get saved, and afterwards we'll get the
Virgin to be content with a smaller candle.'</p>

<p>'Oh God, where are my thoughts!' cried the Duke bethinking
himself. 'I must be going mad! God help me!'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
And he fell a-praying with renewed fervour; but now visions
of Leonardo's crystal globes tormented him, and the tiresome
chant of the gilded boy&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Tornerà l'età dell' oro,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Cantiam tutti: "Viva il Moro!"'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then all vanished, and he sank in a profound slumber.
When he awoke he fancied but two or three minutes had
elapsed. He left the chapel, and saw through the frosted
window-pane the grey light of the winter's dawn.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>X</h3>

<p>Il Moro returned to the <i>Sala della Rocchetta</i>, where reigned
a mournful silence. A woman passing with a basket of
swaddling clothes, approached him and said.</p>

<p>'Her Excellency has been delivered.'</p>

<p>'Does she live?' he stammered, very pale.</p>

<p>'Yes, she lives; but the infant is still-born. She is very
weak; and she desires to speak with your Highness.'</p>

<p>He went to her room; and there on the pillows he saw
a small shrunken face like a child's, pallid and calm, with
great eyes surrounded by livid circles, and turbid as if a
spider's web were drawn over them; familiar and yet strange.
He bent over her silently.</p>

<p>'Send for Isabella! Quickly!' she gasped.</p>

<p>He gave the order; and presently the tall, young, graceful
woman with the proud sad look, the widow of Gian Galeazzo,
entered the room and approached the dying Beatrice. All
retired except Ludovico and the confessor.</p>

<p>For a few minutes the two women whispered together.
Then Isabella kissed the other's cold forehead, knelt by the
bedside and prayed, covering her face with her hands.</p>

<p>Beatrice signed to her husband.</p>

<p>'Vico, forgive me! Weep not. Remember my spirit
will be always with you. I know it was I only&mdash;I only
whom&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>She could not complete the sentence, but he understood
her meaning.</p>

<p>'It was I only whom you loved.' Slowly she turned her
eyes to him, eyes already darkening, and murmured:&mdash;</p>

<p>'One kiss&mdash;on my lips....'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
The monk was reciting the last prayers for the dying, and
the attendants, who had re-entered, responded in chorus.</p>

<p>The Duke felt the lips beneath his own turn cold and stiff;
in that long kiss she had breathed her last faint sigh.</p>

<p>'She is dead,' said Marliani.</p>

<p>All knelt, making the sign of the cross. Il Moro raised
himself very slowly, his face rigid, expressive less of grief
than of extreme tension of spirit; he breathed heavily and
loud like one toiling up the steep hillside. Suddenly he
stretched out his arms, gave one wild cry:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Bice!' and fell senseless upon the corpse.</p>

<p>Of the spectators Leonardo alone had remained calm;
his clear searching eyes were fixed upon the Duke. The
look of supreme suffering in a human face, or its expression
in the gestures of the body, was to his eyes a rare and
beautiful manifestation of nature, an exceptional experience.
Not a wrinkle, not the quivering of a muscle escaped his
passionless all-seeing eyes. Presently, over-mastered by the
desire to draw, he slipped from the room to fetch his sketch-book.</p>

<p>In the lower halls, whither the artist bent his steps, the
candles were dying out in black smoke and gutterings of
wax. The chariots of Numa and Augustus, and all the
pompous allegorical paraphernalia employed to glorify Il
Moro and his Beatrice, were unspeakably melancholy and
wretched in the morning brilliance. In one room he saw
the overthrown and trampled <i>Arco dell' Amore</i>.</p>

<p>Standing by the moribund fire he was beginning his sketch,
when in the chimney-corner he noticed the boy who had
personified the Golden Age. He had fallen asleep, huddled
up, his hands clutching his knees, his head dropped upon
them. The faint heat from the dying embers had not sufficed
to warm the poor little naked and gilded body. Leonardo
touched him on the shoulder, but the child did not look up.
He moaned piteously and the artist took him in his arms.
Then he opened frightened eyes, blue as violets, and wailed.</p>

<p>'Let me go home! Let me go home!'</p>

<p>'What is your name?' asked Leonardo.</p>

<p>'Lippi. Let me go home! Let me go home! I am so
cold. I feel so sick.'</p>

<p>His eyelids fell heavily, and he babbled deliriously.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Tornerà l'età dell' oro,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Cantiam tutti: "Viva il Moro!"'</p>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Leonardo wrapped the boy in his own cloak, laid him in a
chair and roused the servants in the ante-chamber who were
sleeping off the effects of their cups. He learned from them
about the child: that he was motherless, the son of a tinker
in the <i>Broletto Novo</i>, who, for twenty scudi, had sold his
child to the mumming, though warned that he might die of
being gilded. Leonardo returned, wrapped the boy snugly
in his furs, and was carrying him out of the palace to the
nearest drug shop that the paint might be removed from his
skin. Suddenly, however, he paused, for he remembered the
drawing he had just commenced, and the interesting look of
despair in Ludovico's face.</p>

<p>'Ah, well,' he thought, 'I shall scarce forget it. The chief
thing is the wrinkle over the arched eyebrows, and the strange
smile which one might think full of serenity, even of enthusiasm.
The expression of immense grief is like enough
to that of immoderate joy; and truly Plato has said that the
two emotions, rising upon different bases, converge at their
apex.'</p>

<p>Then feeling the tremble of the frozen child, he added to
himself ironically&mdash;</p>

<p>'Poor little sick bird&mdash;our Age of Gold!'</p>

<p>And he pressed him with such tenderness to his heart that
the little lad fancied his mother had risen from her grave, and
was comforting him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>Beatrice Sforza d'Este died on Tuesday, the 2nd of January
1497, at six in the morning. The Duke remained by her
corpse for twenty-four hours, refusing food and sleep. It
was feared his reason would give way. On Thursday morning
he called for writing materials and wrote to Isabella
d'Este, sister of the dead Duchess, a long letter breathing
bitterest grief.</p>

<p>'It had been easier for me to have died myself,' he wrote;
'I pray you send me no condolence nor messenger.'</p>

<p>After writing he was induced to eat a little, not presenting
himself at table but being served in solitude by Ricciardetto.</p>

<p>He had proposed to leave the disposing of the funeral to
Bartolomeo Calco, his secretary; arranging himself merely
the order of the procession. But his interest became aroused,
and presently he was planning details of the ceremonial with
the same zeal he had shown in ordering the magnificent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
festival of the Golden Age. He fixed the precise weight of
the funeral tapers; the number of <i>braccia</i> of gold brocade and
of black cramoisie for the altar cloths; the largess of small
coin, pease, and tallow to be distributed among the poor in
the name of the deceased. Choosing the cloth for the
mourning of the court functionaries, he did not omit to
feel its weight with his fingers, and to make sure of its
quality by holding it to the light. For himself he ordered
a special mourning garb (<i>abito solenne di lutto profondo</i>)
having holes torn in it to simulate the rendings of despairing
frenzy.</p>

<p>A few days later Il Moro caused the tomb of the still-born
child to be inscribed with a pompous epitaph composed
by himself and translated into Latin by Merula.</p>

<p>'I, unhappy child, have perished before I have seen the
light; more unhappy in that, dying, I have ravished life from
my mother&mdash;from my father his consort. In this adverse
fate but one consolation remains to me; that I was born
of parents equal unto gods. In the year 1497, the third of
the Nones of January.'</p>

<p>Il Moro stood a long time contemplating this inscription,
cut in gold letters upon a slab of black marble covering the
infant's grave. It was in the Monastery of Santa Maria delle
Grazie, where Beatrice also slept her last sleep. The Duke
shared the naïve enthusiasm of the stone-mason, who having
finished his work drew back and admired it from a distance,
putting his head on one side, closing one eye, clucking his
tongue, and murmuring in an ecstasy of satisfaction:&mdash;</p>

<p>'This is no tomb, but a jewel.'</p>

<p>One morning when the snow on the housetops shone white
against the rich blue of the sky, and in the crystal air was
that freshness like the fragrance of lilies which seems to be
the perfume of snow, Leonardo da Vinci passed from the
sunlit frost into a dark close chamber hung with black
taffeta, where the shutters were rigorously closed, and funeral
tapers were still alight&mdash;the chamber of Ludovico, who for
many days had refused to leave it.</p>

<p>The Duke spoke of the <i>Cenacolo</i> which was to glorify the
place where Beatrice was laid. Then he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Leonardo, they tell me you have taken under your wing
that urchin who played the Golden Age at our ill-omened
feast. What of him?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
'He is dead, Most Illustrious. He died on the day of Her
Grace's funeral.'</p>

<p>'Died!' echoed the Duke. 'Nay, but that is strange!'
And he dropped his head on his hands, sighing heavily.
Then he stretched his hand to Leonardo.</p>

<p>'Yes! yes!' he cried; ''twas destined to fall out thus.
Truly our Golden Age is dead; dead together with my incomparable
one, for it could not, it should not, survive
her. Is it not a truth, <i>amico mio</i>, that here we have a strange
coincidence&mdash;theme for a tremendous allegory?'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>The whole year was passed in the deepest mourning. The
Duke did not lay aside his garment of woe, nor did he
present himself at table, but ate off a tray held before him by
courtiers.</p>

<p>'Since his lady's death,' wrote the Venetian ambassador,
Marin Sanuto, 'Il Moro has become very devout, is present
at all church ceremonies, fasts, and lives continently (so at
least they say), and has in his plans the fear of God constantly
before his eyes.'</p>

<p>In the daytime the Duke was able to forget his bereavement
in the affairs of state, though even here he felt the lack
of Beatrice; during the night the intensity of his grief redoubled.
Often in dreams he saw her as she had been
when he had married her; sixteen, childish and wilful,
slim, dark; almost like a boy; so untamed that sometimes
she hid herself in cupboards to avoid assisting at state
ceremonials, and for three months after their marriage
defended herself with her teeth and her nails from her
husband's caresses. One night, five days before the first
anniversary of her death, he dreamed of her as she had been
one day long ago when there had been a fishing party on the
banks of the lake in her favourite country house of Cusnago.
Fish had been plentiful, and the buckets were filled to the brim.
Having turned up her sleeves, the young Duchess had amused
herself throwing the creatures by handfuls back into the
water, laughing and delighting in the joy of the released
captives, in the flash of their scales as they plunged deep
into the clear water. The perch, the roach, the bream
wriggled in her bare hands, then catching the sun they glowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
like brilliants; and the smooth olive cheek of the beautiful
girl glowed too. Upon awaking, Ludovico found his pillow
wet with tears. He rose and went to the Convent delle
Grazie, and prayed long at his wife's tomb; then he dined
with the prior and disputed with him upon the burning
theological question of the hour, the Immaculate Conception
of the Blessed Virgin. When it grew dark, Il Moro left
the monastery, and went straight to the dwelling of Madonna
Lucrezia.</p>

<p>His grief for his wife, his fear of God, in no wise militated
against love for his mistresses. On the contrary, he clung to
them more closely than before; the more so that of late the
Countess Cecilia and Madonna Lucrezia had become bosom
friends. Cecilia, though a blue-stocking or <i>dotta eroina</i>, as it
was then called, and famed as the 'new Sappho,' was at bottom
a simple good-hearted creature, somewhat easily run away
with by enthusiasms. Upon the death of the Duchess she
found opportunity for one of those exploits of love of which
she had read in romances; she would make common cause
with Lucrezia, her young rival, that together they might comfort
the duke! At first Lucrezia was jealous and hard to
win, but the magnanimity of the <i>dotta eroina</i> finally disarmed
her, and she opened her heart to this anomaly in female
friendship.</p>

<p>In the summer Lucrezia bore a son; the Countess desired
to be his godmother, and though herself the mother of
children by the Duke, lavished on the infant extravagant
tendernesses and called herself his grandam. Thus Il Moro's
prophetic dream had been realised, and his mistresses were
friends. To celebrate the auspicious arrangement, he caused
Bellincioni to write a sonnet in which Lucrezia and Cecilia
were figured as the Morning and the Evening glow; while
he, disconsolate widower, stood between them.</p>

<p>This evening, entering the familiar luxurious chamber of
the Palazzo Crivelli, he found the ladies side by side before
the fire. Of course, like the rest of the court, they were
dressed in the deepest mourning.</p>

<p>'How is your Excellency in his health?' asked the Evening
Glow. She was quite unlike her rival, but no less attractive,
with her white skin, flame-coloured hair, and hazel eyes clear
as the water in a mountain tarn.</p>

<p>The Duke had complained of ill health lately, and though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
this evening he felt rather better than usual, languidly
answered, from force of habit:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Ah, madam, you can easily conceive to what condition I
am reduced. My mind is occupied but with one subject,
how soonest I may be laid to rest beside my dove.'</p>

<p>'Nay, nay, your Excellency must not speak so!' said
Cecilia with deprecating hands. 'Think, if Madonna
Beatrice could hear you! All sorrow comes from God,
and must be accepted even with thankfulness.'</p>

<p>'You speak well,' replied Il Moro, 'I would not murmur.
Nay, then, God forbid! Blessed are they that mourn, for
they shall be comforted.'</p>

<p>And he raised his eyes to heaven, pressing closely the
hands of the two ladies.</p>

<p>'May the Lord reward you, my dear ones, that you have
not abandoned the poor widowed one!'</p>

<p>He wiped his eyes, and then drew two papers from the
pocket of his mourning attire. One was a deed of gift by
which he gave the rich lands of the Villa Sforzesca to the
Monastery delle Grazie.</p>

<p>'But,' said the Countess, astonished, 'I had thought your
Highness adored this villa.'</p>

<p>'My love for terrestrial things is dead. And, madam,
what need has one man with lands so large?'</p>

<p>Cecilia laid her rosy fingers on his lips with sympathetic
reproach. Then she asked curiously:&mdash;</p>

<p>'And this other paper, what is it?'</p>

<p>At this his face cleared, and the old, gay, somewhat cunning
smile appeared on his lips.</p>

<p>He read the second document aloud, also a deed of gift,
with recital of the lands, woods, hamlets, hunting rights, and
other advantages which he, Ludovico, Duke of Milan, was
conferring on Madonna Lucrezia Crivelli and his natural son
Giampaolo. With the rest was included the villa of Cusnago,
Beatrice's favourite country house, renowned for its fisheries.</p>

<p>The last words of the document Ludovico read in trembling
tones:&mdash;</p>

<p>'In the wondrous and rare bonds of great love, this lady has
showed unto us entire devotion and displayed such loftiness
of sentiment that often in our intercourse with her we have
experienced an entrancing and exceptional delight, added to
great lightening of our cares.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
Cecilia clapped her hands and fell on her friend's neck,
her eyes wet with maternal tenderness.</p>

<p>'Did I not tell you, my sweet sister, that he had a heart
of gold? Now my little grandson, Giampaolo, has the richest
inheritance in Milan.'</p>

<p>'What date have we?' asked Il Moro.</p>

<p>''Tis the 28th of December,' replied Cecilia.</p>

<p>'The 28th!' he echoed pensively.</p>

<p>It was the day, the hour, when a year ago Beatrice had
surprised her husband with his mistress. The room was
unchanged; the same winter wind howled in the chimney;
the bright fire burned on the hearth, and above it danced the
chain of naked cupids or cherubs. On the round table with
the green covering stood the same crystal goblet of <i>Balnea
aponitana</i>; the same mandoline, the same sheets of music
littered the floor. The doors opened into the bedroom, and
there was the wardrobe in which he had taken refuge.</p>

<p>What would he not give, so he thought, if he might at this
moment hear the rap of the knocker on the great door, if
the frightened maid should run in with the cry, 'Madonna
Beatrice!' Yes, he would gladly once again tremble in the
wardrobe like a caught thief, hearing in the distance the indignant
voice of the lady of his love. Alas! it could not be,
that time had gone by for ever! His head sank and tears
filled his eyes.</p>

<p>'Oh, <i>Santo Iddio</i>!' said Cecilia, turning to her friend,
'he weeps anew. Rouse yourself! Coax, comfort him!
Console him! How can you be so cold?'</p>

<p>And gently she pushed her rival into the Duke's arms.</p>

<p>Lucrezia had long felt sickened by this unnatural friendship.
She would have liked to get up and go away; nevertheless
she took the Duke's hand. He smiled at her through his
tears and laid it upon his heart.</p>

<p>Cecilia took the mandoline, and, assuming the pose in
which twelve years ago Leonardo had painted her, sang one
of Petrarch's lyrics for Laura:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Levommi il mio pensiero in parte ov' era</p>
<p>&nbsp;Quella ch'io cerco e non ritrovo in terra.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Duke, much moved, wiped his eyes, and stretching
out his hands as to a dissolving vision, he repeated the
last line:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'E compie' mia giornata innanzi sera.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
'Ah, yes, my dove, thou didst indeed finish thy day before
the evening!... Ladies, sometimes it seems to me as if she
smiled upon us three from heaven. Ah, Bice, Bice, <i>mia
adorata!</i>'</p>

<p>He drew Lucrezia to him, and presently Cecilia rose and
left them together. The 'Evening Glow' was not jealous
of the 'Dawn'; from long experience she knew that soon
again her turn would come. Her mandoline sounded from
the next room.</p>

<p>And above the merry firelight, the naked cupids of
Caradosso's moulding prolonged their eternal dance, laughing
madly around the nails, the lance, the crown of thorns.</p>

<h3 class="p2">I</h3>

<p>'See here! On the map of the Indian Ocean, westward of
the island of Taprobane, we find a note&mdash;"The Sirens:
prodigies of the sea." Christopher Columbus told me that
having come there and found no sirens, he was greatly
astonished. But you smile. Why?'</p>

<p>'Oh, nothing! Go on, Guido; I am listening.'</p>

<p>'I know very well, Messer Leonardo, that you don't
believe in sirens! Well, and what would you say of the
skiapodes, who use their feet as parasols; or the pygmies,
whose ears are so large that they make one a bolster, the
other a blanket; or of the tree which bears eggs for its
fruit, from which come yellow downy chickens, so fishy-flavoured
they may be eaten on fast-days; or of that marine
monster upon which certain mariners, believing it an island,
disembarked and lighted a fire for the cooking of their
supper? This last is a very true tale, related by an aged
mariner from Lisbon, a man in no wise given to wine, and
who swore and swore again by the blood and the body of
Christ, that he spoke what was true.'</p>

<p>This conversation took place six years after the discovery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
of the New World, on Palm Sunday, at Florence, in a room
above the storehouse of Messer Pompeo Berardi, a shipbuilder,
who had a branch establishment at Seville, and
superintended there the building of ships for sailing to the
New Continent. Messer Guido Berardi, Pompeo's nephew,
was an impassioned seaman; he had prepared to take part in
Vasco di Gama's expedition, when he was stricken by the
terrible disease called French by the Italians, and Italian by
the French; German by the Poles, Polish by the Muscovites,
Christian by the Turks. In vain he had consulted all
physicians, in vain he had made waxen offerings at every
wonder-working shrine; paralysed, condemned to eternal
immobility, he preserved an extraordinary activity of mind,
and by listening to sailors' stories, and sitting up all night
over books and maps, he sailed the oceans of imagination,
and made discoveries by proxy. His room, which sextants,
compasses, astrolabes, made like a ship's cabin, opened on to
a balcony, a Florentine loggia. The clear sky of a spring
evening was already darkening; the flame of the lamp
flickered in the wind; from the storehouse below were
wafted odours of spices&mdash;cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and
cloves.</p>

<p>'And so, Messer Leonardo,' he concluded, rubbing his
unhappy legs under their coverlet, ''tis not meaningless the
saying that faith removes mountains. Had Columbus
doubted like you, he had accomplished naught. Confess,
I pray you, is it not worth grey hair at thirty to have found
the Earthly Paradise?'</p>

<p>'Paradise?' said Leonardo; 'nay, how is that?'</p>

<p>'What? Have you not heard? Know you not that by
observations on the Pole Star, taken by Messer Cristoforo
near the Azores, he has proved that the world has not the
shape of an apple, as is commonly supposed. 'Tis a pear,
with a protuberance like the nipple of a woman's breast.
On this nipple, a mountain so high that its summit leans
against the lunar sphere, lies the Earthly Paradise.'</p>

<p>'But, <i>caro</i> Guido, science....'</p>

<p>'Science!' cried the other contemptuously. 'Know you,
Messere, what Columbus says of science? I will quote you
his words in his <i>Libro de las Profecias</i>. He says: "Not
mathematics, nor the charts of geographers, nor the arguments
of reason, helped me to my deed, but solely the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
prophecy of Isaiah touching a new heaven and a new
earth."'</p>

<p>Here Guido fell silent, for at this hour began the nightly
racking of his joints. He was carried to his bed; and
Leonardo, left alone, entertained himself verifying those
observations upon the Pole Star which had led to so singular
a delusion; and, in truth, he found errors so gross that he
could not believe his eyes.</p>

<p>'What ignorance!' he said to himself more than once; 'it
would seem he has discovered the New World by chance,
groping at random. He himself sees no more than a blind
man, nor doth he know what it is he has discovered; he
thinks it is China or Solomon's Ophir; or, by my faith, the
Earthly Paradise! Death will overtake him before he has
learned the truth.'</p>

<p>He read the first letter, dated April 29th 1493, in which
Columbus informed Europe of his discovery: 'the letter of
Christopher Columbus, to whom our age oweth much touching
the newly-found islands beyond the Ganges.'</p>

<p>Leonardo spent the whole night over the calculations and
the maps. At times he went out upon the loggia and looked at
the stars, thinking of this finder of the new heaven and the
new earth&mdash;that strange dreamer with the mind, and the heart,
of a child. Involuntarily he compared this man's destiny with
his own.</p>

<p>'How little he knew; how much he did! And I, with all
my knowledge, am helpless as the paralysed Berardi. I, too,
have aimed at unknown worlds, but have made no step
towards them. Faith, say they, faith! But is not perfect
faith the same as perfect knowledge? Cannot these eyes of
mine see farther than those eyes of Columbus, the blind
prophet? Or is it the caprice of Fate that men must see to
know; must be blind to act?'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
Leonardo did not notice that the night was passing. The
stars went out one by one; rosy light overspread the sky and
shone upon the tiled roofs and the wooden cross-beams of
the old brick houses; the street became gay with the hum of
the people going forth to their daily toil. Presently a knock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
came to the door, and Giovanni Boltraffio entered, to remind
his master that this was the day for the 'Trial by fire.'</p>

<p>'What trial?' asked Leonardo.</p>

<p>'Fra Domenico on behalf of Fra Girolamo, and Fra
Giuliano Rondinelli on behalf of his enemies, will pass
through the fire. That one who is unhurt will be proved by
God to be in the right.'</p>

<p>'Very good; you can go, Giovanni, and I wish you good
entertainment.'</p>

<p>'Will you not come also, Master?'</p>

<p>'No. I am busy.'</p>

<p>Giovanni took a step towards the door; then, trying to
appear indifferent, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I am sorry you are so occupied. As I came hither I met
Messer Paolo Somenzi, who promised to bring us to a place
where we could see excellently. The trial is not till mid-day.
If you could finish your work by then, we might yet be in
time.'</p>

<p>Leonardo smiled. 'You want me so much to see the
prodigy? Very well, then; we'll go together.'</p>

<p>At the appointed time Messer Paolo Somenzi arrived. He
was a spy in the pay of the Duke of Milan, and a bitter enemy
of Savonarola's: a restless, fussy little man, with brains
of quicksilver.</p>

<p>'How is this, Messer Leonardo?' he began in a harsh
disagreeable voice, with much gesticulation. 'You thought
of refusing your presence? Has this physical experiment no
attraction for the devotee of natural science?'</p>

<p>'But will the magistrates really permit them to go into the
fire?' asked Leonardo.</p>

<p>'<i>Chi lo sa?</i> But one thing is certain, that Fra Domenico
will not shrink from the flames. Nor is he the only one!
More than two thousand of the citizens, rich and poor, wise
and simple, women and children, declared last night at the
Convent of San Marco that they were ready to follow Fra
Domenico to this singular test. I tell you there is such a
frenzy abroad that the most sensible feel their heads go
round. The very philosophers are taking fright, and asking
themselves if there is not a chance of neither champion being
burned. But for my part, I am wondering how the Piagnoni
will look when, on the contrary, the two poor fools are slain
before their eyes!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
'Does Savonarola really believe?' exclaimed Leonardo,
as if thinking aloud.</p>

<p>'I suspect he has his doubts and would fain draw back.
But 'tis too late. To his own hurt he has so debauched the
imagination of this people that now they require a miracle at
all costs. See you, Messere, 'tis a pure question of mathematics,
and of a kind no less interesting than yours: if God
really exist, why should he not do a miracle&mdash;why should he
not cause two and two to make five? as, verily, the faithful
daily request, that the impious like you and me, Messer
Leonardo, may be put to eternal confusion.'</p>

<p>'Well, let us set forth,' said Leonardo, interrupting Messer
Paolo with ill-concealed aversion.</p>

<p>'Soft, though,' said the other; 'one little whisper more.
You and I, Messer Leonardo, are of one mind in this matter;
and at the day's end we shall cry "Victory!" whether God exist
or no. Two and two will always make four. <i>Viva la Scienza!</i>
and long live logic!'</p>

<p>The streets were crowded, and on all faces was that air of
curiosity and happy expectation which Leonardo had already
remarked in Giovanni. The press was greatest in the Via de'
Calzaioli before the Orsanmichele, where was a bronze statue
by Andrea Verrocchio:&mdash;the apostle Thomas thrusting his
fingers into the wounds of his Lord. Here the eight theses,
the truth or falsity of which was to be demonstrated by the
fire, were appended to the wall, 'writ large' in vermilion
letters. Some of the crowd were spelling them out, others
listening and making their comments.</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="theses" cellpadding="1">

</table></div>

<p>Jostled by the crowd, Leonardo and his companions stopped
to listen to the remarks of the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
'It is all gospel truth,' said an old artisan; 'nevertheless
deadly sin may come of it.'</p>

<p>'What sin is stinking in your old nostrils, Filippo?' asked
a lad, smiling contemptuously.</p>

<p>'There can be no sin in it,' said another.</p>

<p>'It's a trap of the Evil One,' said Filippo undaunted.
'We are demanding a miracle. But we may be unworthy of
a miracle. Is it not written in Scripture, "Thou shalt not
tempt the Lord thy God?"'</p>

<p>'Hold your tongue, old man! Is not a mustard-seed of
faith able to raise mountains? God cannot avoid a miracle
once we have faith.'</p>

<p>'No! He can't! He can't!' cried many voices.</p>

<p>'But who is to go into the fire first? Fra Domenico or
Fra Girolamo?'</p>

<p>'The two together.'</p>

<p>'No, Fra Girolamo will only pray. He is not going in.'</p>

<p>'You don't know what you are talking about. 'Twill be
first Fra Domenico, then Fra Girolamo, and then all of us
who wrote ourselves down last night at the convent.'</p>

<p>Is it true that Fra Girolamo is going to raise a dead
man?'</p>

<p>'Of course it is true! First the trial by fire, and then the
resurrection of the dead. I, myself, have seen his letter to
the pope. He challenges him to send a man who shall
descend into a tomb with Fra Girolamo, and say to the dead,
"Come forth!" He who shall resuscitate the corpse shall be
the true prophet; and the other the deceiver.'</p>

<p>'Have faith, brothers, only have faith! Many miracles
await you. Ye shall see the Son of Man in his flesh and
bones coming on the clouds, and other wonders, of which
ancient times had not even the conception!'</p>

<p>At these words several cried 'Amen'; and all faces grew
pale, and all eyes burned with the wild fires of fanaticism.
The crowd moved on, carrying Messer Paolo and the others
with it. Giovanni threw one more look at Verrocchio's
bronze figure. In the good-humoured, half-contemptuous
smile of the incredulous apostle, he seemed to see the smile
of Leonardo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>As they approached the Piazza della Signoria, the press
was so great that Paolo requested one of the mounted guards
to escort them as far as the balcony, where places were
reserved for the orators, and for the more important of the
citizens.</p>

<p>Never, thought Giovanni, had he seen so great a multitude.
Not only was the square packed with spectators, but the
loggias, the towers, windows, and roofs of the houses. Like
limpets, they clung to the iron lamp-brackets, gratings,
gutters, eaves, rain-pipes. They hustled each other and
fought for room, and some fell and were trampled out of life.
All the approaches to the piazza were rigorously barred with
iron posts and chains; at three places only, men of full age
and unarmed were permitted to pass singly.</p>

<p>Messer Paolo explained to his companions the manner in
which the pyre was constructed. There were two long narrow
piles of wood smeared with tar and sprinkled with powder,
which extended from the Ringhiera or rostrum, where stood the
Marzocco (the ancient lion of Florence), as far as to the Tettoia
del Pisani. Between the two piles was a narrow lane, paved
with stones, sand, and clay, along which the two friars were
to pass.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour the Franciscans appeared from one
side, the Dominicans from the other; the procession was
closed by Fra Domenico, in a velvet habit of brilliant red,
and Fra Girolamo dressed in white, and bearing the <i>Ostensorio</i>,
which glittered in the sunlight. The Dominicans intoned a
Psalm:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Come and see the works of God, he is terrible in his
doing toward the children of men!'</p>

<p>And the crowd responded, 'Hosanna, Hosanna! Blessed
is he who cometh in the name of the Lord!'</p>

<p>The enemies of Savonarola occupied half the Loggia dei
Lanzi, his followers the opposite half, a partition having been
erected between them. All was now ready; nothing
remained but to light the fire and call forth the champions.</p>

<p>At last the judges of the trial came from the Palazzo
Vecchio, and every one held his breath and watched what
they would do; but after speaking a few words in a low voice
with Fra Domenico they retired again, and suspense reigned as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
before. Fra Giuliano Rondinelli had gone out of sight. Then
the tension of spirit became almost insupportable, and the
crowd stood on tiptoe, and craned their necks, making the sign
of the cross and telling their beads, and murmuring childish
prayers: 'Lord, Lord! perform us a miracle!'</p>

<p>The air was sultry; a thunderstorm was drawing nearer,
and growls of thunder which had been heard at intervals all
day, were becoming louder and more insistent. Certain
members of the council, in long robes of red cloth, like the
togas of ancient Rome, issued from the Palazzo Vecchio and
took places on the Ringhiera; an old man with spectacles
and a quill behind his ear, evidently the clerk, tried to recall
them with shouts of:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Messeri! Messeri! the sitting is not ended! the voting
is in progress!'</p>

<p>'To the devil with the voting,' said one of the magistrates;
'I have had my fill of this stupid discussion. The noise
has broken my ear-drum.'</p>

<p>'What is the use of deliberation?' said another. 'If they
wish to burn themselves let them do it, and Good-night to
them!'</p>

<p>'By my troth, it were homicide!'</p>

<p>'And an excellent homicide, too! Two fools less on
earth.'</p>

<p>'But they must be burned according to the rule and canon
of the Holy Church. It's a delicate theological question.'</p>

<p>'Well, then, propose the question to the pope.'</p>

<p>'What have we to do with the pope? We are concerned
with the people. If by such means one could restore the
people to sanity, there would be no great evil in sending all
the priests and friars in the world, not only into the fire, but
into the water and under the ground likewise.'</p>

<p>'Water will serve. Throw them both into a tub of water,
and let him who comes forth dry be the victor. 'Twould be
a thought less dangerous than these pranks.'</p>

<p>'Have you heard, most honourable signiors,' said Messer
Paolo with deep reverences, 'that poor Fra Giuliano has
fallen sick in his stomach? 'Tis a malady caused by fear,
and he has been bled for it.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' exclaimed an old man of imposing aspect, his face
showing at once distress and intelligence, 'you make a jest of
everything. But I, when I hear such talk from the men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
highest in the state, I ask myself whether it were not better
to die. Truly, if the founders of this city could rise from the
dead and see the folly and the infamy of this day's proceedings,
they would flee back into their graves for shame.'</p>

<p>The judges, meanwhile, came and went incessantly from the
Loggia to the Palazzo, from the Palazzo to the Loggia, and it
seemed as if the deliberations were to have no end.</p>

<p>The Franciscans first accused Savonarola of having
enchanted Fra Domenico's habit; he therefore removed it,
but it was alleged that sorcery might have influenced his
under garments. He retired into the Palazzo Vecchio,
stripped himself naked, and donned the vesture of another.
Then the Franciscans demanded that he should hold aloof
from Savonarola, lest his new garments should be enchanted;
and that he should give up the cross which he held. To this
Domenico consented, but protested that he would not enter
the flames without the Holy Sacrament in his hands. The
Franciscans at this swore that Savonarola's disciple wished
sacrilegiously to burn the body and blood of Christ. In
vain Domenico and Girolamo replied that the Holy Sacrament
could not be reduced to ashes; the material part (<i>modus</i>)
might indeed be burned, but not the eternal and incorruptible
part (<i>substantia</i>). An interminable scholastic dispute now
began between the two parties.</p>

<p>The crowd in the piazza was beginning to murmur, and
dense black clouds were spreading over the sky. Suddenly
from behind the Palazzo Vecchio and the Via de' Leoni
where the lions of Florence were kept in cages, a prolonged
and hungry roar was heard. The mob imagined that the
bronze Marzocco, indignant with his city, was roaring out his
wrath. They responded with a sound no less furious, no less
hungry.</p>

<p>'Have done! Have done! To the fire at once! Fra
Girolamo! We <i>will</i> have the miracle! We <i>will</i> have the
miracle!'</p>

<p>At this cry Savonarola, who had been kneeling in prayer,
rose, shook himself, approached the parapet of the Loggia,
and with imposing gesture commanded silence. But the
people refused to be silent. And then some one from under
the Tettoia de' Pisani cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>'He's afraid!'</p>

<p>And this cry was taken up and passed along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
A company of horsemen of the Arrabbiati tried to push
their way to the Loggia to fall upon Savonarola and seize
him, making their profit of the confusion.</p>

<p>'Kill him! Kill him! Down with the cursed schismatic!'
was the shout</p>

<p>Boltraffio closed his eyes that he might not see those
furious faces which had now lost all look of humanity;
nothing, he thought, could save Savonarola from being torn
to pieces.</p>

<p>At this moment the storm broke. Rain descended, the
like of which had not been seen in Florence.</p>

<p>It endured but a short time, and when it was over the trial
by fire had become an impossibility. For between the twin
piles of faggots the water ran with the fury of a channel
hemmed in between dykes.</p>

<p>Some laughed.</p>

<p>'Well done, friars! They undertook to tread the fire, but
they've got to swim for it! That's their miracle, eh?'</p>

<p>Cursed by the crowd, Savonarola on his return to his
convent was escorted by soldiers, and Giovanni's heart bled
as he watched the deposed prophet, kicked and buffeted,
making his way with faltering step, his eyes on the ground,
his white garb splashed with the mire of the streets. Leonardo
saw his disciple's wan face, and, as before at the 'Burning of
Vanities,' took his hand and led him away.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Next day in the Casa Berardi, sitting in the chamber
which was so like a ship's cabin, Leonardo tried to prove to
Messer Guido that Columbus had erred in locating Paradise
on a swelling upon a pear-shaped earth. At first Guido
listened and argued, then mournful silence fell on him. He
was vexed with his friend for telling him the truth. Presently
he discovered pains in his legs, and had himself carried away.</p>

<p>'Why have I hurt him?' thought Leonardo; 'He wants a
miracle too!'</p>

<p>Turning over his note-book, his eyes fell on the words he
had written that night when the Milanese mob had attacked
his house for the seizure of the Holy Nail: 'O marvellous
justice of Thee, Thou Prime Mover, who hast denied to no
force the order and the qualities of its necessary effect!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
'There!' he exclaimed, 'there is the miracle!'</p>

<p>And his thoughts turned to his <i>Cenacolo</i> and to the face of
Christ, still sought for, not yet found; and he felt that
between this inviolable law of Necessity, and the perfect
wisdom of Him who said, 'One of you shall betray me,'
there existed a deep correlation.</p>

<p>In the evening Giovanni came with the day's news. The
Signoria had exiled Fra Girolamo and Fra Domenico from
the city; and the 'Enraged,' brooking no delay, had besieged
San Marco with a countless throng of armed persons, and
had broken into the church where the brothers were at
vespers. They defended themselves, fighting with burning
tapers, candlesticks, and crucifixes; in the cloud of smoke
they seemed ridiculous as angry doves. One climbed on the
roof and hurled stones down from it. Another fired an
arquebus from the altar, shouting at each discharge '<i>Viva
Cristo!</i>' Presently the monastery was taken by storm.</p>

<p>The brethren entreated Savonarola to flee, but he, together
with Domenico, gave himself up, and they were haled to
prison. The guards were unable or unwilling to defend them
from the insults of the crowd, who struck Fra Girolamo from
behind, crying:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Prophesy unto us, thou man of God, who is he that
smote thee?'</p>

<p>Others crawled at his feet as though seeking something,
and cried: 'The key? The key? Where is Fra Girolamo's
key?'</p>

<p>&mdash;in allusion to the key often spoken of in his sermons, with
which he would unlock the secrets of the abominations of
Rome.</p>

<p>The very children who had belonged to the Sacred Troop
of inquisitors now pelted him with apples and rotten eggs.
Those who could not penetrate the crowd howled from a
distance, reiterating their abuse till their throats were hoarse.</p>

<p>'Dastard! Coward! Judas! Sodomite! Sorcerer!
Antichrist!'</p>

<p>Giovanni followed him to the doors of the prison of the
Palazzo Vecchio, whence he was not to issue till the day of
his execution.</p>

<p>On the following morning Leonardo and Boltraffio quitted
Florence.</p>

<p>At once, on arrival in Milan, the painter set himself to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
task which had baffled him for eighteen years&mdash;the face of
the Christ in the 'Last Supper!'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>V</h3>

<p>On the very day of that trial by fire, which in Florence had
had such bad results&mdash;Charles <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, King of France, died
very suddenly. The news was of sinister import to Il Moro,
for the Duke of Orleans, who was now to ascend the throne
as Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>, was descended from Valentina Visconti,
daughter of the first Duke of Milan. He claimed to be the
only legitimate heir of the dominion of Lombardy, and now
proposed to reconquer it, annihilating 'the robber nest of
the Sforzas.'</p>

<p>Shortly before the change of sovereigns in France, there
had taken place at the Milanese court what was called a
'scientific duel,' and Il Moro had found so much entertainment
that he proposed another for a day two months later.
Now that war was impending some supposed he would postpone
this duel, but Ludovico, who was an adept in the arts
of dissimulation, had no such intention. He wished his
enemies to think he cared little for their designs, but was
absorbed in that revival of art and learning, 'the fruit of
golden peace,' which flourished under his mild rule, and
brought him the fame of being the most enlightened Italian
potentate, the protector of the Muses, protected not merely
by the arms but by the admiration of his people.</p>

<p>Accordingly on the appointed day, in the Great Hall of the
Rocchetta, which was called the <i>Sala per il giuoco della palla</i>,
there assembled all the doctors, deans, and masters of the
University of Pavia, wearing their scarlet four-cornered
<i>berrette</i>, their ermine-bordered hoods, their violet gloves, and
pouches of gold embroidery. Ladies were present dressed in
sumptuous festal robes, amongst them Lucrezia and Cecilia,
sitting together at the foot of Ludovico's throne. The proceedings
were opened by a pompous oration from Giorgio Merula,
in which the Duke was likened to Pericles, Epaminondas,
Scipio, Cato, Augustus, Mæcenas, and other worthies, while
Milan was celebrated as the new Athens, of surpassing glory.
Then followed a theological dispute on the Immaculate
Conception, then medical discussions on the following
questions:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
'Is a handsome woman more prolific than an ugly one?'</p>

<p>'Was the healing of Tobias natural?'</p>

<p>'Is woman an incomplete creation?'</p>

<p>'In what part of the body was formed the water which
issued from the side of the crucified Christ?'</p>

<p>'Is woman more sensual than man?'</p>

<p>Then came the turn of the philosophers, on the unity or
the plurality of primal matter.</p>

<p>'Be good enough to expound me this apophthegm,' said a
toothless old man with venomous smile, and eyes dull and
troubled as those of a sucking babe; a great doctor of
scholastics, who thoroughly understood the confounding of
opponents by subtle distinctions (<i>quidditas et habitus</i>) which
nobody could understand.</p>

<p>Alone and thoughtful as was his custom, Leonardo was
listening, and now and then his lips curled.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>
Pointing to Leonardo, the Countess Cecilia whispered to
the Duke, who called up the artist, and begged him to take
part in the discussion.</p>

<p>'Be kind,' insisted the countess. 'Do it for my
sake&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Lay aside your bashfulness,' said Ludovico, 'and tell us
something entertaining. Speak to us of your observations
upon nature. Do we not know that your brain is always
stuffed with chimeras?'</p>

<p>'Your Excellency must excuse me. Madonna Cecilia, I
would gladly please a lady, but, truly, I cannot&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Leonardo was not feigning. He was neither able nor
willing to speak before a crowd. An insuperable barrier
seemed to lie between his thought and his word, as if speech
must either exaggerate or be inadequate to the sense, modify
or vitiate it. In his note-books he continually cancelled,
erased, corrected, and revised; in conversation he stammered,
lost the thread, sought for words and could not find
them. He called both orators and authors 'babblers,' but in
secret he envied them. The frequent glibness of insignificant
persons was a wonder and an annoyance to him.</p>

<p>'That God should give such men such skill!' he would
say, with a kind of ingenuous admiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
However, the more firmly Leonardo declined the task
offered him, so much the more did the ladies insist.</p>

<p>'We beseech you, Messere! We all pray you with one
voice. Tell us, tell us something entertaining!'</p>

<p>'Tell us how men are to fly!' suggested Madonna
Fiordiligi.</p>

<p>'Nay, but speak to us of sorcery!' cried Madonna
Ermellina; 'something of black magic! 'Tis so interesting,
this necromancy. Explain to us how they raise the dead
men from their graves!'</p>

<p>'I assure you, Madonna, I have never raised any dead
person from his grave.'</p>

<p>'Then take some other theme, so it be terrible, and have
no savour of mathematics.'</p>

<p>Leonardo was always hard put to it to refuse a beggar, and
he could only repeat with embarrassment:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Truly, Madonna, I am incapable&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>But Ermellina interrupted him, clapping her hands.</p>

<p>'He consents! He consents! Silence for Messer
Leonardo! Listen ye all!'</p>

<p>'Eh? Who? What?' asked the dean of the theological
faculty, who was deaf, and somewhat fallen into dotage.</p>

<p>''Tis Leonardo!' shouted his neighbour into his ear.</p>

<p>'Leonardo Pisano, the mathematical professor?'</p>

<p>'No, Leonardo da Vinci himself.'</p>

<p>'Is he doctor or master?'</p>

<p>'No, nor even bachelor. Leonardo, the painter of the
<i>Cenacolo</i>.'</p>

<p>'Is he going to speak of painting?'</p>

<p>'It seems he will speak of natural science.'</p>

<p>'Are the painters so learned? I have never heard of this
Leonardo. What has he written?'</p>

<p>'Nothing that I know of.'</p>

<p>'Nay,' said another, ''tis certain that he writes, for they
say he uses his left hand, and produces a caligraphy proper
only to himself, which none can read.'</p>

<p>'Which none can read? With his left hand?' said the
old dean.</p>

<p>'I take it, gentlemen, this speech will be some jest; an
interlude to entertain the Duke and the ladies.'</p>

<p>'Very like 'twill be ridiculous. We shall see.'</p>

<p>'Just so, just so. 'Tis necessary to amuse the folk of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
court. And painters are witty fellows enough. Buffalmacco,
now&mdash;they said he was a perfect jester. Well, let us see what
this Leonardo is good for.'</p>

<p>And the old man polished his spectacles, the better to
enjoy the comedy.</p>

<p>Leonardo was still looking supplicatingly at the Duke, but
though smiling, Ludovico was determined; and the Countess
Cecilia menaced the hesitant with her finger.</p>

<p>'If I refuse I shall offend them,' thought the artist; 'and
very soon I shall be requiring bronze for the Cavallo. Well,
I will say the first thing that comes into my head, just to be
quit of the business.'</p>

<p>And with desperate resolution he mounted the tribune and
threw a glance upon the learned assembly. Then, blushing
and stammering like a boy who does not know his lesson, he
began:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I must warn you, gentlemen, I am not prepared....
'Tis to please the Duke. I would say&mdash;I mean&mdash;in fine,
I will speak to you about shells.'</p>

<p>And he told of petrified marine animals, the imprints of
coral, and water-plants found on hills and in valleys far
removed from the sea, evidence of how the face of the earth
has been changing from time immemorial. There, where
now are hills and dry land, once was the ocean. Water,
the mover of Nature, her 'charioteer,' creates and destroys
the very mountains; the shores gradually remove into
the centre of the sea, and the inland seas lay bare their
beds, traversed by some river which ever hurries towards
the sea, scoring for itself a deep channel. Thus the Po,
which now rushes across the dried-up lake of Lombardy,
will eventually score itself a deep channel across the dried-up
Adriatic; and the Nile, when the Mediterranean has become
a country of hills and plains like Egypt and Libya, will empty
itself into the Atlantic Ocean beyond the Pillars of Hercules.</p>

<p>'I am convinced,' said Leonardo in conclusion, 'that
the study of petrified plants and animals, which we have
hitherto neglected, will lay the foundation of a new science
of our earth; of its past, and of its future.'</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the awkwardness of his delivery,
Leonardo's ideas were so clear and precise, his faith in
knowledge was so sure, all he had said was so unlike the
Pythagorean ravings of the previous disputant, and the dry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
bones of logic in the mouths of the learned doctors, that when
he stopped speaking a stupor of amazement was seen on the
faces of the audience. Were they to laugh or to applaud?
Was this talk of a new science the vain chatter of a
presumptuous fool?</p>

<p>'Truly, my Leonardo,' said the Duke condescendingly,
as if speaking to a child, 'it would be famous fun if
the Adriatic were to dry up and leave our enemies, the
Venetians, stranded like crabs on a sandbank.'</p>

<p>At this they all laughed, well pleased to be told the line
they were to take, for courtiers are ever weathercocks turned
by the wind. Messer Gabriele Pirovano, the Rector of the
University of Pavia, an old gentleman with silver hair, fine
manners, and a dignified but somewhat foolish face, thus
delivered himself, reflecting in his smile the condescending
kindness of the Duke:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Messer Leonardo, the information you have given us is
very interesting; but were it not perhaps simpler to explain
the origin of these little shells, as a charming (we might even
say poetic) but wholly accidental freak of nature, rather than
as the foundation of an entire new science? Or, as others
have done before us, we might account for their presence by
the catastrophe of the universal Deluge.'</p>

<p>'Oh, the Deluge!' said Leonardo, who had conquered his
shyness and now spoke with a freedom which to many
appeared excessive and even irreverent; 'I know that explanation,
but it won't do at all. Judge for yourself, Messer
Gabriele. According to the man who measured it, the level
of the waters of the flood exceeded by ten cubits the tops of
the highest mountains. The shells would have settled on
the summits, not on the sides or the feet of the mountains,
nor within caverns; and, withal, they would have settled at
haphazard according to the pleasure of the waters, and not
everywhere at the same level, not in consecutive layers, as we
find by observation. And further, here is a wondrous thing.
We find collected together all those creatures which are used
to live in societies, such as oysters, cuttlefish, molluscs; while
those which are used to be solitary are scattered singly in
their fossil state just as we find their descendants now on the
seashore. I myself have often noted the position of these
petrified shells in Tuscany and in Lombardy and in Piedmont.
And if you tell me 'twas not the waves carried them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
but that of themselves they gradually rose in crowds above
the water as it grew higher, that, too, is easily refuted, for a
shellfish is as slow a beast as a snail. It floats not, but crawls
with its valves over sand and stones, and the furthest it can go
in a day's hard journeying is some three or four arm-lengths.
How then, Messer Gabriele, would you explain, that in the
forty days of the flood's duration, your shellfish could creep
the two hundred and fifty miles which divide the hills of
Monferrato from the shores of the Adriatic? Only he who,
despising experiment and observation, judges of Nature from
books, can maintain such an argument; not he who has had
the curiosity to see with his own eyes those things of which
he speaks.'</p>

<p>An uncomfortable silence followed; all felt that the Rector's
reply had been a trifle weak. Then the court astrologer,
Ambrogio da Rosate, a great favourite of the Duke's, advanced
another explanation based on Pliny's natural history; which
was that the petrified shapes which looked like marine
animals had been formed in the interior of the earth by the
magic working of the stars.</p>

<p>At the word magic, a resigned smile played over Leonardo's
lips. 'Then, Messer Ambrogio,' he replied, 'how would you
explain the fact that the stars in the one place should make
animals not only of many kinds but of various ages? (for the
age of shells can be ascertained no less than the age of horns
or of trees). What say you to finding some of these shells
entire, some broken, some mixed with sand, mud, the claws
of crabs, fish-bones, and rubble, such as you may see any day
on the seashore; and the delicate imprint of leaves on the
rocks of the highest mountains, and marine weeds clinging to
the shells, petrified and blended into one lump with them?
From the working of the stars, say you? If this is to be
our reasoning, Messere, then in all Nature there will be no
phenomenon for which you cannot account by the starry
influences, and all science outside astrology is useless.'</p>

<p>Here an old Doctor of scholastic interposed, saying that the
dispute was irregular.</p>

<p>'For,' he exclaimed, 'either this question of fossils belongs
to a vulgar, mechanical science, alien to metaphysic, and
hence not to be discussed in an assembly met to contend
solely about philosophical questions, or it verily pertains to
the true, the sublime science of dialectic; in which case it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
must be discussed according to the laws of dialectic, which
alone allows theory to ascend to the sphere of pure speculation.'</p>

<p>'I understand you, Messere,' said Leonardo patiently; 'I
have thought of what you say. But the alternative is not as
you state it.'</p>

<p>'Not as I state it?' cried the veteran smiling angrily, 'not
as I state it? Then, sir, pray let us hear how <i>you</i> propose
to state it!'</p>

<p>'Nay, nay; I had no wish to offend. In fine, I spoke but
of shells. I think&mdash;nay, Messere, but there is no vulgar
science, nor is there sublime science. There is but one
science; that which is based upon the experience of the
senses.'</p>

<p>'The experience of the senses? Then where would you
put the metaphysic of Aristotle, of Plato, of Plotinus, and
of all the ancient philosophers who speculated upon God,
upon the soul, and upon the essences? Would you say of
all this&mdash;&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'That it is not science,' replied Leonardo calmly. 'I
recognise the greatness of the ancients, but not in that
respect. In science they mistook the road. They wished to
learn what was beyond the reach of knowledge, and what was
within their reach they despised. They led men astray for
many ages. Discussing matters which admit not of proof,
it is impossible for men to agree; the less so if they would
make up for the lack of proof by vehemence of clamour.
He who truly <i>knows</i> has no occasion to shout. The voice
of truth is unique; and when it has spoken, all the noise
of dispute must be hushed. If the cries continue, it means
that the truth has not yet been found. Do we need mathematical
dispute as to whether twice three be six or five?
or whether the angles of a triangle be or be not equal to two
right angles? In these instances doth not contradiction cease
in the presence of truth? and is not truth to be enjoyed as
it never can be enjoyed in sophistical and imaginary
sciences?'</p>

<p>Leonardo would have spoken further, but after a glance at
the face of his opponent he became silent.</p>

<p>'Ah!' said the doctor of scholastic, ironically, 'I thought
we should arrive at an agreement! You and I were certain
to understand one another! But one thing I do not understand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Pardon the ignorance of an old man! If our knowledge
of God and of a future life, not being confirmed by
the testimony of our senses, but by the testimony of Holy
Writ&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I spoke not of this,' interrupted Leonardo; 'I leave out
of the dispute the books inspired by God, for they are of
the substance of supreme truth.'</p>

<p>He was not allowed to continue; uproar ensued. Some
shouted, some laughed; some, springing from their chairs,
turned wrathful faces on him, while others, shrugging their
shoulders, left the assembly.</p>

<p>'Make an end! Make an end!'</p>

<p>'But, gentlemen, permit me to reply&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'There is no occasion for reply.'</p>

<p>'When things are stated contrary to sense&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I desire to speak!'</p>

<p>'Plato and Aristotle!' ...</p>

<p>'Not worth a rotten egg!'</p>

<p>'But I ask, shall this be permitted? The truth of our
Holy Mother Church&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Heresy! Heresy! Atheism!'</p>

<p>Leonardo remained silent, his face calm and sad. He was
alone among these men who believed themselves the servants
of knowledge, and he saw the impassable gulf which separated
him from them. He was displeased, not with his opponents,
but with himself for having broken his accustomed silence, and
become entangled in an argument; for having conceived (in
defiance of experience) that it were possible to reveal the
truth unto men, or that they were able to receive it.</p>

<p>As for the Duke, though he had long lost the thread of
the argument, he continued to follow the disputation with
delight.</p>

<p>'Good! Really good!' he applauded, rubbing his hands.
'Madonna Cecilia, will they not, think you, presently come
to blows? Look at that old fellow, shaking all over, brandishing
his cap, clenching his fists! And the little black one
behind him, foaming at the mouth! And all about a few
fossil shells! Fine madmen, these scholars! kittle cattle!
And our Leonardo, who pretended to be possessed by a
dumb devil!'</p>

<p>And they laughed, watching the scientific duel as if it were
a cock-fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
'I shall have to save my Leonardo,' said Il Moro at last,
'or these red-capped folk will claw him.'</p>

<p>And he rose and passed through the crowd of infuriated
philosophers, who suddenly were hushed into silence as they
made way for him. Soothing oil had been poured upon stormy
waves; one smile from the prince sufficed for the reconciliation
of metaphysics and natural science. He closed the discussion
by a courteous invitation to supper.</p>

<p>'I am glad,' he said with his usual gaiety, 'that the
Adriatic is not yet dry; because I trust that its oysters,
which I have had cooked for your entertainment, may give
rise to less contention than the shells of Messer Leonardo.'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>During the supper Fra Luca Pacioli, who was sitting beside
Leonardo da Vinci, whispered in his ear:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Forgive me, friend, that I kept silence when they attacked
you. They did not understand your meaning, but you might
easily make an alliance with them, for the one opinion does
not exclude the other. Avoid extremes.'</p>

<p>'I entirely agree with you, Fra Luca,' replied Leonardo.</p>

<p>'That's the way; love and concord. What is the object
of dissension? Metaphysics are good, and mathematics are
good! Room for both. Is it not so, dear friend?'</p>

<p>'Precisely so, Fra Luca.'</p>

<p>'I was sure you would agree. You give in to me, I give
in to you; we are allied, you with us, we with you.'</p>

<p>Leonardo looked at the astute countenance of the mathematical
monk, who reconciled Pythagoras and Thomas
Aquinas so easily; and he thought&mdash;</p>

<p>'The calf sucks from two dams.'</p>

<p>Then the alchemist, Galeotto Sacrobosco, raising his glass
and bending towards Leonardo with the air of an accomplice,
said&mdash;</p>

<p>'To your good health, Master! How skilfully you played
them on the line! What a subtle allegory!'</p>

<p>'Allegory?' repeated Leonardo, stupefied.</p>

<p>'To be sure, Messere. No call for mystery with me.
We shall not betray one another. By dry land you meant
sulphur; by the sun, salt; by the ocean which overflowed
the mountains, quicksilver. Do I catch your meaning?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
'Precisely, Messer Galeotto.'</p>

<p>'You see even we are good for something! As for the
shells, by them you intended the philosopher's stone, the
alchemist's secret, composed of what? why of sulphur, salt,
and quicksilver!'</p>

<p>And he laughed his jolly childlike laugh, raising his forefinger
and arching his brows, which were scorched by the
fury of his immense furnaces.</p>

<p>'And all these great doctors with their red caps understand
not a word of it! To your health, Messer Leonardo, and to
the glory of alchemy, our common mother!'</p>

<p>'I honour the toast, Messer Galeotto. And as I see
nothing can be concealed from you, I will vex you with no
further mysteries.'</p>

<p>After supper the party broke up: only a small and selected
company were invited by the Duke into a cool snug room,
where wine and fruits were served.</p>

<p>'Most charming! Insurpassable!' cried Madonna Ermellina.
'I should never have conceived it could be so diverting.
Better than a <i>festa</i>! How they shouted at Leonardo! Pity
he might not finish&mdash;he would have told us of his spells and
necromancy.'</p>

<p>'Perchance 'tis calumny,' said an old courtier; 'but I am
told the infection of heresy has so taken hold of Leonardo,
that he scarce credits the existence of God. He holds it of
greater moment to be a philosopher than a Christian.'</p>

<p>''Tis mere babble,' said the Duke. 'I know the man
well, and I swear he has a heart of gold. He is violent in
word, but in practice would not hurt a flea. He dangerous!
Would that all dangerous ones were as he! The Father
Inquisitors would have him, but let them roar! None shall
hurt a hair of my Leonardo!'</p>

<p>'And our posterity will praise your Excellency for having
protected a genius so extraordinary,' said Messer Baldassare
Castiglione, a very elegant cavalier from the court of Urbino.
''Tis pity,' he added, 'that the man should neglect his art
to give himself to dreams and chimeras.'</p>

<p>'True, Messer Baldassare; I have often reproached him.
But painters, you know, are an unmanageable race.'</p>

<p>'Your Excellency speaks well,' said the Commissioner of
the Salt Tax, who was burning to tell a tale of Leonardo;
'painters are impracticable folk. T'other day I came to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
studio seeking an allegorical drawing for a marriage chest.
"Is the master at home?" say I. "No," is the reply, "he
hath gone forth, greatly busied, to measure the weight of the
air." Truly, I thought the youth mocked me; but when I
met Leonardo himself and taxed him with this folly, he
confessed it, looking at me as if he thought I were a fool.
Ladies, how like you the notion? and how many grains will
you find in the spring zephyr?'</p>

<p>'I know worse of him than that,' said a young lord with
a vulgar self-complacent face; 'he has invented a boat which
travels up stream, yet without oars.'</p>

<p>'How doth it travel?'</p>

<p>'On wheels, by steam.'</p>

<p>'A boat with wheels? Nay, sir, this must be your invention
of this moment!'</p>

<p>'I had it of Fra Luca Pacioli, who had seen the design.
Leonardo conceives that in steam lies a force able to move
large ships, let alone little boats.'</p>

<p>'You see! You see! Did I not tell you!' cried Madonna
Ermellina, 'this is his necromancy, black magic pure and
simple!'</p>

<p>''Tis not to be denied he is mad!' said the Duke with his
urbane smile; 'for all that I wish him well. In his company
I never weary!'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Leonardo went homewards by the quiet suburb of Porta Vercellina. It was a lovely evening. Goats were contentedly browsing along the edge of the road; and a rugged sunburnt little lad was driving a flock of geese. Storm-clouds, lined with gold, were rising in the north over the unseen Alps, and high up in the clear sky there burned a single star.</p>

<p>The artist walked slowly; he was thinking of the scientific dispute which he had just left, and then his thoughts went back to the trial by fire at which he had been present in Florence. He could not but think the two duels resembled each other like twins.</p>

<p>A little girl of six was eating rye-bread and onions on the outside staircase of a cottage. He called her, and after a moment's hesitation, reassured by his smile, she trotted to him, smiling herself. He gave her a sugared and gilded orange which he had brought from the supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
'Gold ball!' said the child.</p>

<p>'No, not a ball. A sort of apple. Try it; 'tis sweet within.'</p>

<p>She continued to stare ecstatically at the unfamiliar dainty.</p>

<p>'What is your name?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Maia.'</p>

<p>'I wonder, Maia, if you know how the cock, the goat, and the donkey went a-fishing together?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Shall I tell you?'</p>

<p>And he fondled her soft wild curls with his delicate, almost womanish, hand. 'Come here then! Let us sit down! Wait a minute, though, I think I have some nice cakes also, as you won't try my golden apple!' And he turned out his pockets. A young woman now appeared, looked at Maia and at the stranger, nodded approvingly, and seated herself with her distaff. Then came also the grandmother, a bent old woman with eyes like Maia's. She, too, looked at Leonardo; but suddenly, as if recognising him, she made a sign with her hands and whispered to her daughter, who sprang up saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Maia! Maia! Come away at once!'</p>

<p>The child hesitated.</p>

<p>'Come, run, naughty one; unless you wish&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The little girl was frightened and fled to the grandmother, who snatched the orange from her and flung it over the wall to the pigs. The child cried, but the old woman whispered something in her ear which at once checked her sobs, and she sat gazing at Leonardo with wide eyes full of terror. The painter turned away, well understanding. The old woman thought him a sorcerer capable of bewitching the child. A sad smile on his lips, still mechanically searching for the cakes no longer needed, pained at heart by the little one's needless fear, he felt himself more of an outcast than in face of the crowd which had sought to kill him, the learned men who fancied his truths the ravings of a madman. He felt himself as far removed from his fellows as was that solitary star shining in the still undarkened sky.</p>

<p>He went home and shut himself into his study. With
its dusty scientific instruments and its dull books, it seemed
to him gloomy as a prison. However, he lighted a candle,
seated himself, and became immersed in his latest research,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
in inquiry into the laws of the motion of bodies travelling
on an inclined plane. Like music, mathematics had ever for
him a soothing influence; and to-night, they brought him
the hoped-for consolation. Having finished his calculations,
he took his diary, and writing with his left hand, and from
right to left, so that reading must be in a mirror, he recorded
a few thoughts roused by the scientific disputation.</p>

<p>'The disciples of Aristotle, men of words and of books,
because I am not a <i>letterato</i> like themselves, think me incapable
of speech on my own subjects. They perceive not
that my matters are to be expounded rather by experience
than by words; experience, which truly was mistress of all
those who have written well; which I will take for my mistress,
by which, in all cases, I will stand or fall.'</p>

<p>The candle had burned low; and the cat, faithful comrade
of his sleepless nights, sprang on the table, purring and rubbing
herself against him. The solitary star, seen through the
undusted windows, seemed still farther away, still less attainable.
He remembered Maia's frightened eyes, but he had
vanquished his melancholy. He was solitary, yes, but undaunted
and serene. Nevertheless, unknown to himself,
there was bitterness in the secret depth of his heart like a
hot spring beneath the ice of a frozen river; there was
almost remorse, as if, verily, he were guilty concerning Maia;
as if there were something for which he was unable entirely
to forgive himself.</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Next morning Leonardo, with Astro carrying sketch-books,
paint-boxes and brushes, was on his way to the monastery
for a day's work on the figure of the Saviour. He stopped
in the courtyard to speak to Nastasio, who was busily grooming
a grey mare.</p>

<p>'Bravo!' said the master, 'and how is Giannino to-day?'
Giannino was his favourite horse.</p>

<p>'Giannino is all right,' answered the groom, 'but the
piebald is lame.'</p>

<p>'The piebald?' said Leonardo, vexed; 'and since when?'</p>

<p>'Since four days agone,' replied Nastasio surlily; and without
looking at his master, he continued curry-combing the
mare's hindquarters with such energy that she changed her
feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Leonardo, however, wished to see the piebald, and the
groom took him to the stable. When Giovanni Boltraffio, a
few minutes later, came to the courtyard fountain for his
morning wash, he heard the master talking in loud piercing
tones almost feminine in their shrillness, which he used in
rare passions of sudden, violent, but not dangerous anger.</p>

<p>'Tell me this instant, you fool, you drunken ape, tell me
who bade you summon the horse-leech?'</p>

<p>'I pray you, Messere, could a sick horse be left without
a leech?'</p>

<p>'A pretty leech! Think you, fool, that stinking plaster&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>''Tis not so much a plaster as a charm. You are not
learned in these matters, and that is why you are so
wroth.'</p>

<p>'The devil take you and your charms together! How
could that ignoramus cure anything when he knows naught
of the structure of the body, and has never heard the name
of anatomy?'</p>

<p>'Anatomy, forsooth!' said Nastasio, raising lazy contemptuous
eyes to his master.</p>

<p>'Ass!' shouted the latter; 'take yourself off out of my
service!'</p>

<p>The groom did not move an eyelash.</p>

<p>'I was on the stroke of leaving you on my own account.
Your Excellency owes me three months' wages; and as regards
the oats, 'tis no fault of mine. Marco gives me no money
for oats.'</p>

<p>'What's the meaning of all this? Once I issue my
orders&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Nastasio shrugged his shoulders and returned to his
grooming of the grey mare, working violently as if venting
his spleen on the dumb animal.</p>

<p>Meantime Giovanni, amused by the altercation, was smiling
as he scrubbed his face with a coarse towel.</p>

<p>'Shall we set out, Master?' asked Astro, wearied by
the delay.</p>

<p>'Wait,' replied Leonardo; 'I must ask Marco about the
oats. I would know how much truth is in the words of this
scoundrel.'</p>

<p>And he returned to the house, Giovanni following him.
Marco was in the studio, working as usual by rule and
with mathematical accuracy, perspiring and panting as if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
he were rolling a weight uphill. His closely compressed
lips, the disorder of his red hair, his red fat ineffectual fingers,
seemed to say, 'Patience and perseverance will conquer all
things.'</p>

<p>'Marco! Is it true you give out no money for the horses'
oats?'</p>

<p>'Of a surety it is true.'</p>

<p>'How is that, friend?' exclaimed the painter, his look
having already become timorous before the stern face of him
who was steward of the household. 'I bade you, Marco,
take heed to remember the oats. Have you forgotten?'</p>

<p>'No, I have not forgotten; but there is no money.'</p>

<p>'I guessed as much. There is always this lack of money.
None the less, Marco, I ask you, can horses live without
oats?'</p>

<p>Marco threw his brush away angrily. And Giovanni
noticed how the master and the scholar seemed to have
changed places.</p>

<p>'Hearken, Master!' said Marco. 'You bade me take
charge of the housekeeping, and not trouble you. Why
do you yourself re-open the matter?'</p>

<p>'Marco!' said Leonardo, with gentle reproach, ''twas but
a week ago that I gave you thirty florins.'</p>

<p>'Thirty florins! Pr'ythee count it up. Of this thirty, four
were a loan to Pacioli, two to that eternal sponge, Messer
Galeotto Sacrobosco; five went to the body-snatchers for
your anatomy studies; three for mending the glass and the
stoves in the hot room for your reptiles and fishes; and
six golden ducats went for that spotted devil&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Do you mean the camelopard?'</p>

<p>'Precisely; the camelopard. We have nothing to eat
ourselves, but we feed that cursed beast. And whether we
feed him or not, 'tis clear that he will die.'</p>

<p>'Never mind, Marco,' said Leonardo gently; 'if he die I
will dissect him. The neck vertebræ of these animals are
very curious.'</p>

<p>'The neck vertebræ! Oh, Master! Master! if you had
not all these fancies for horses, and corpses, and giraffes, and
fish, and every sort of beast, we might live as lords, asking
alms of no one. Is not daily bread better than caprices?'</p>

<p>'Bread? Have I ever asked for anything better than
bread? Oh, I know very well, Marco, you would like to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
the death of all my creatures, though they cost me so much
trouble and expense to obtain. They are indispensable
to me&mdash;more so than you can imagine. You want to have
everything your own way.'</p>

<p>Helpless injury trembled in the voice of the Master; and
Marco maintained a sulky silence.</p>

<p>'But what is to become of us?' continued Leonardo.
'Already a famine of oats? We were never in such straits
before.'</p>

<p>'We have always been in straits,' said Marco, 'and we
always shall be. What can you expect? For a year we have
not had a <i>quattrino</i> from the Duke. Messer Ambrogio
Ferrari says daily, "to-morrow! to-morrow!" and to my
thinking he but mocks us.'</p>

<p>'Mocks us! Well, I will show him how to mock at me!
I will complain to the Duke! I will give that scurvy piece,
Ambrogio, a lesson he shall not forget! the Lord send him
an evil Easter!'</p>

<p>Marco made a vague gesture, as if to say it was not
Leonardo who would teach lessons to the Duke's treasurer.
Then an expression of kindness and love came over his hard
features, and he added soothingly:&mdash;</p>

<p>'No, no, Master, let it be! God is merciful, and we shall
get along in some fashion. If you really take it to heart, I
will find the money even for your oats.'</p>

<p>And Marco reflected that he could use some of his own
money, a little hoard he had been making for his mother.</p>

<p>'The oats are not the major question,' said Leonardo,
sinking wearily on a chair, and defending his eyes as if from
a cruel wind. 'Hearken, friend, there is a thing I have not
yet told you; next month I shall absolutely require eighty
ducats, which I have had on loan. There is no need to stare
at me with those eyes, Marco.'</p>

<p>'Of whom had you the loan?'</p>

<p>'Of the money-changer, Arnoldo&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Of Arnoldo! Oh, Master! what have you done? Don't
you know he is worse than any infidel or any Jew? Why
did you not tell me at once?'</p>

<p>Leonardo hung his head.</p>

<p>'I wanted the money&mdash;be not so wroth, Marco!' he said;
and added piteously, 'Bring the reckonings, perhaps we shall
be able to devise something.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Marco was convinced they could devise nothing; however,
finding absolute obedience the best way of influencing the
Master, he fetched the account-books. Leonardo's brow
contracted in a look of disgust, and he watched the opening
of the too familiar green volume with the air of one looking into
a gaping wound; then together they plunged into calculations,
and it was wonder and pity to see the great mathematician
making the blunders of a child in the additions and the
subtractions. Now and then he suddenly remembered some
mislaid account of a thousand ducats, sought it, fumbled in
cases and boxes, and dusty piles of papers, but found in its
place trifling and useless memoranda written in his own
hand, such, for instance, as that one of Salaino's cloak:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="cloak">
<tr><td class="tdl">Silver brocade,</td><td class="center">Livre</td><td class="tdr">15</td><td class="center">soldi</td><td class="tdr">4</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">Buttons,</td><td class="center">"</td><td class="tdr">0</td><td class="center">"</td><td class="tdr">12</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>He tore them angrily, and blushing and swearing threw them
under the table.</p>

<p>Giovanni, seeing on the great man's face these marks of
human weakness, murmured to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>'A new Hermes Trismegistus halved with a new Prometheus?
Nay, neither god nor Titan, but a simple mortal
like the rest of us! And to think that I feared him! the
poor kind soul!'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>X</h3>

<p>Two days passed, and as Marco had foreseen, Leonardo
forgot the money question completely. He demanded three
florins for the purchase of a fossil with so confident an air
that Marco lacked courage to refuse him, and handed out the
money from his private hoard. The ducal treasurer, deaf to
Leonardo's entreaties, had still not paid the year's salary, and
was the less likely to do so that Ludovico himself required
great sums to spend in preparation for war with France.
Leonardo was obliged to borrow wherever he could, even
from his own pupils.</p>

<p>Nor was the money forthcoming for the completion of the
Sforza monument. The plaster cast, the mould, the receiver
for the molten metal, the furnace&mdash;all were ready; but when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
the artist presented his estimate for the bronze, Il Moro was
alarmed, and even refused him an interview.</p>

<p>At last, in the end of November, urged by want, he wrote
a letter to the Duke; sentences fragmentary, disconnected,
like the stammering of one overcome by confusion, who does
not know how to beg.</p>

<p>'Signore, knowing that the mind of your Excellency is
occupied with affairs of greater moment, yet fearing that
silence may be a cause of anger to my most gracious patron,
I take freedom to remind your Excellency of my humble
necessities, and of the needs of my art, now condemned to
inactivity.... Two years have passed since I have received
my salary....</p>

<p>'Some persons in your Grace's service can afford to wait,
since they have other revenue, but I with my art, which,
however, I would gladly abandon for one more lucrative....</p>

<p>'My life is at your Excellency's service; and I shall always
be prompt in obedience.</p>

<p>'I speak not of the monument, for I know that the
times....</p>

<p>'It irks me that owing to the necessity of earning my
livelihood I must break off my work, and occupy myself with
trivialities.</p>

<p>'I have had to provide for six persons during fifty-six
months, with only fifty ducats....</p>

<p>'I know not to what I must dedicate my activity....</p>

<p>'Am I to study glory, or only my daily bread ...?'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>One November evening, after a day spent in soliciting the
munificent Gaspare Visconti, and Arnoldo the usurer, and in
coming to terms with the hangman&mdash;who demanded payment
for two corpses (used by the artist for studies), threatening in
default to denounce the purchaser to the Holy Inquisition&mdash;Leonardo
came home greatly wearied and out of heart.
Having dried his clothes by the kitchen fire, and received the
key of his workshop from Astro, he was proceeding thither when
he was surprised by the sound of voices behind the door.</p>

<p>'What?' he said, 'is it not locked? Can it be thieves?'</p>

<p>Recognising the tones of his pupils, Giovanni and Cesare,
he suspected them of prying into his private papers. About
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
to throw open the door, he was arrested by a vivid imagination
of their confusion, and the wide eyes of terror with which
they would greet him. He felt ashamed for them, and went
away, walking on tiptoe as if himself the culprit; presently he
called from the studio:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Astro! Astro! Bring me a light! Where have you all
got to? Andrea! Marco! Giovanni! Cesare!'</p>

<p>The voices in his room were silenced, some glass thing fell
with a crash, there was a shutting of windows. Leonardo
still hesitated, unable to resolve upon entry. In his heart
was not so much anger as disgust.</p>

<p>His suspicions were not amiss. Having entered by the
courtyard window, Giovanni and Cesare had searched his
drawers and opened his papers, drawings, and diaries.
Boltraffio, very pale, held a mirror, and Cesare read the
master's inverted writing:&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>Laude del Sole. I cannot but blame Epicurus, who maintained
that the sun's magnitude is no other than it seemeth.
Socrates astounds me, who, depreciating so great a light, calls it
but a molten stone. And would I had vocables strong enough to
confound those who prefer the apotheosis of man to the apotheosis
of the sun!</i>'</p>

<p>'Shall we pass on?' asked Cesare.</p>

<p>'Read to the end,' said Giovanni.</p>

<p>'<i>Those who worship men for gods</i>,' continued the reader,
'<i>are greatly in error; for man, though he were of the magnitude of
the earth, would appear smaller than the smallest star, a scarce
visible spot upon the universe; and seeing, further, that men in
their sepulture are subject to putridity and decay</i>&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Strange,' observed Cesare, 'that he can reverence the sun,
but appears not to recognise Him who, dying, was the
vanquisher of death.'</p>

<p>He turned the page. 'Let us try this.'</p>

<p>'<i>In all parts of Europe, by great peoples, will be bewailed this
day the death of a man who died in Asia</i>&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You don't understand, Giovanni. I will explain: he
treats of Good Friday. Shall I go on?'</p>

<p>'<i>O mathematicians, throw light upon this error! Spirit exists
not without body, and where is no flesh, nor blood, nerves, tongue,
bone, and muscle, can be neither voice nor movement.</i>'</p>

<p>'I can't make it out; the next lines are erased. We will
pass to the end.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
'<i>Other definitions of spirit I leave to the Holy Fathers,
who know the secrets of Nature by revelation from above.</i>'</p>

<p>'H'm, I would not be Messer Leonardo if these lucubrations
should fall into the hands of the Holy Fathers! Here
we have another of his prophecies.'</p>

<p>'<i>Enough shall there be, who, leaving the ascesis of labour and
poverty, think to serve God by living luxuriously in buildings
like palaces, and in amassing visible wealth at the expense of
the wealth invisible.</i>'</p>

<p>'I conclude he here treats of Indulgences. Quite in
Savonarola's vein! A stone slung at the pope.'</p>

<p>'<i>Those who have been dead a thousand years will be the food
of the living.</i>'</p>

<p>'That passes me! Nay, though, the thousand-year dead
must be the saints in whose name the monks collect money.
A pretty riddle!'</p>

<p>'<i>They shall adore those who do not hear; they shall burn
lamps before those who do not see.</i>'</p>

<p>'Images of saints.'</p>

<p>'<i>Women shall disclose to men their passions, their secret and
shameful deeds.</i>'</p>

<p>'The confessional! How does it like you, Giovanni? A
strange man, is he not? But there is no real malice in these
riddles. It is only jest&mdash;sporting with blasphemy.'</p>

<p>'<i>Many who cozen the simple by dealing in pretended miracles,
punish those who unmask their deceits.</i>'</p>

<p>'The trial by fire, of which the reckless Savonarola was the
victim.'</p>

<p>He laid down the book and looked at his companion.</p>

<p>'Well, is it enough? or do you want further proof?'</p>

<p>Boltraffio shook his head: 'No, Cesare, it is not enough.
Could we but find a place where he speaks <i>plainly</i>!'</p>

<p>'Plainly? Ask not for that. Such is his disposition. He
deals ever double, conceals himself, feigns like a woman.
Riddles are his nature. Nor does he know himself. He is
his own greatest enigma.'</p>

<p>'Cesare is right,' thought Giovanni. 'Better open blasphemy
than these mockings&mdash;this smile as of the unbelieving
Thomas, who thrust his fingers into the wounds of the Lord.'</p>

<p>Then Cesare showed a drawing in red chalk, tossed carelessly
among the machines and the tables of calculations&mdash;the
Virgin with the Child in the desert; seated on a stone, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
was drawing triangles and circles with her finger on the
sand&mdash;the Mother of God teaching the Divine Son geometry,
the principle of all knowledge.</p>

<p>Giovanni gazed long at this strange drawing; then he held
it to the mirror that they might decipher the inscription.
Cesare had scarce read the first words, '<i>Necessity, the eternal
teacher</i>,' when Leonardo's call was heard:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Astro! Bring me a light! Andrea! Marco! Giovanni!
Cesare!' Then Giovanni turned pale. The mirror fell from
his hands, breaking into pieces.</p>

<p>'An evil omen,' said Cesare with a smile.</p>

<p>Like thieves caught in the act they pushed the papers
into their places, picked up the fragments of the mirror,
opened the window, sprang to the ledge and, clinging to
the water-pipe and the branches of the vine, dropped into the
court. Cesare missed his hold, fell, and sprained his foot.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>That evening Leonardo did not find his accustomed solace
in his mathematics. He walked the room, seated himself,
began a drawing, flung it aside. His mind was vaguely
uneasy; there was something he must decide, yet could not.
His thought reverted continually to the same thing; how
Boltraffio had fled to Savonarola, had returned, and for
a time had settled down to work, recovering his calm
in the pursuit of art; but ever since that disastrous trial
by fire, and especially since the news of the prophet's
approaching execution had reached Milan, he had again
been racked by doubts and regret. Leonardo understood
how he suffered; how again he felt the necessity to go away,
yet could not make up his mind to leave; how terrible was
the struggle in a nature too deep not to feel, too weak to
overcome its own contradictions. Sometimes Leonardo
fancied he must himself drive his disciple away in order to
save him.</p>

<p>A bitter smile came to his lips as he thought:&mdash;</p>

<p>'It is true that I&mdash;I only&mdash;have ruined him! 'Tis a just
accusation that I have the evil eye! How am I to help
him?'</p>

<p>He rose and mounted the steep dark stair, knocked at a
door, and receiving no answer opened it and went in. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
narrow room the darkness was scarce broken by the little
lamp burning before the figure of the Madonna; rain was
splashing on the roof, and the autumn wind howled mournfully.
A black crucifix was suspended against the white wall.
Giovanni, still dressed, his face hidden in the pillow, lay in
the unrestful position of a suffering child.</p>

<p>'Are you asleep?' asked the Master, bending over him.</p>

<p>He started up, with a faint cry, gazing with the same
terror-struck eyes and defensive hands that Leonardo had
seen with the little Maia.</p>

<p>'Why, Giovanni! Giovanni! What is the matter? It is
only I!'</p>

<p>Boltraffio came to himself, passing his hand slowly over
his eyes.</p>

<p>'Ah! it is you, Messer Leonardo! I fancied&mdash;I have had
a terrible dream! But is it really <i>you</i>?' he repeated, his
brows contracted as if he could hardly believe his eyes.</p>

<p>The Master sat on the bedside and touched the lad's
forehead.</p>

<p>'You have fever. Why did you not tell me?'</p>

<p>Giovanni would have turned away, but looking afresh at
Leonardo, and joining his hands supplicatingly, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Drive me out! Drive me from you, Master! I shall never
myself have the courage to go. I am guilty towards you&mdash;a
vile traitor.'</p>

<p>For answer Leonardo embraced him, drawing him to his
breast.</p>

<p>'What say you, my son? Do you think I have not seen
your distress? If there is anything in which you think you
have wronged me, I pardon it. Perhaps some day you will
be asked to pardon me!'</p>

<p>Astonished, Giovanni gazed at him with dreaming eyes,
then suddenly hid his face in his breast, sobs shaking his
frame as he murmured:&mdash;</p>

<p>'If ever again I am obliged to leave you, oh, Master, do
not think it is for lack of love! I myself know not what has
happened to me. Sometimes I fear I am losing my reason.
God has forsaken me! Oh, never, never suppose&mdash;for truly
I love you more than all else in the world! I love you more
than Fra Benedetto, who is as my father. Never will any one
love you as do I!'</p>

<p>Leonardo soothed him like a child. 'Enough! Enough!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
Think you I credit not your love, my poor lad? Has Cesare
suggested&mdash;but why do you heed Cesare? He is clever, and
he, too, loves me well, for all he thinks to hate me; but there
are matters beyond him.'</p>

<p>The disciple had become calm, and his tears were dry.
Raising himself, and fixing scrutinising eyes on the Master, he
shook his head.</p>

<p>'No; it was not Cesare. 'Twas I myself. And yet no; it
was not I, but <i>he</i>.'</p>

<p>'Who is <i>he</i>?'</p>

<p>Giovanni again trembled, and pressed closer to his friend.
'No, no! For God's sake let us not speak of <i>him</i>!'</p>

<p>'Listen, my son,' answered Leonardo, in that soothing yet
severe and almost rough tone in which a doctor speaks to a
sick child; 'I see you have a weight upon your heart. You
must tell me all; all, do you hear? Thus only shall I be
able to help you;' and after a pause he added: 'Tell me of
whom you spoke just now.'</p>

<p>Giovanni looked round as if in fear; then whispered in low,
awestruck tones:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Of your Semblance.'</p>

<p>'My Semblance? How mean you? Did you see it in a
dream?'</p>

<p>'No; in reality.'</p>

<p>For a moment Leonardo thought him delirious.</p>

<p>'Messer Leonardo, three nights ago you, yourself, came to
me as you have come to-night?'</p>

<p>'No, I did not come. Why do you ask? Can you not
remember yourself?'</p>

<p>'I do remember. Master, now I am certain it was <i>he</i>!'</p>

<p>'But what has given you this idea? What happened?'
He felt that Giovanni wished to speak, and sought to force
him to do so, in the hope it would afford him relief.</p>

<p>'This is what happened. Three nights ago he came to me
as you have come to-day at this very hour, and he sat on the
edge of the bed as you do now, and in every word, in every
motion he was as you; and his face was like yours, only as
if seen in a glass, nor was he, like you, left-handed, so I
thought at once within myself, perchance it was not you; and
he knew my thought, yet dissembled and made no sign, but
pretended that we both knew naught. Only on leaving he
turned himself round to me and said: "Hast thou never,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
Giovanni, seen that one in my likeness? If so be thou dost
see him, be not at all afraid." And from his saying this I
understood all.'</p>

<p>'And you still believe this, my poor boy?'</p>

<p>'How should I not believe it, when I saw him as now I see
you? Ay, and he spoke with me!'</p>

<p>'Of what did he speak?'</p>

<p>Giovanni covered his face with his hands, and did not
answer at once.</p>

<p>'It was not good,' he said at last in deprecating tones; 'he
said terrible things to me. He said that there was nothing in
the world but Mechanics&mdash;things like that terrible spider
with the bloody revolving arms, which he&mdash;no, not he&mdash;which
<i>you</i> have invented.'</p>

<p>'What spider? Ah yes, yes! I understand; you have
seen my drawing of the scythed chariot?'</p>

<p>'And he said,' resumed Giovanni, 'that what men call God
is the eternal force by which the hideous spider is moved, by
means of which its blood-stained arms revolve; and that this
God cares nothing for truth or untruth, for good or evil, for
life or death. And that praying to him is bootless, for he is
inexorable as mathematics; two and two will never, never
make five.'</p>

<p>'I see. I see. You torture yourself uselessly. I know
how it is.'</p>

<p>'No, Messer Leonardo, you do not yet know all. He said
that Christ had died in vain, had not risen triumphant from
the grave, had not vanquished death, but that His body lay
mouldering in the tomb. And when he said this, I burst into
weeping, and he had compassion on me, and tried to bring
me comfort. And he said: "Weep not! There is no Christ,
but there is Love, Great Love, the daughter of Great Knowledge.
Who knoweth all, loveth all." Master, he used your
very words! "Of old," he said, "they taught that love came
of weakness, of wonder, of ignorance; but I tell you it comes of
strength, of truth, of wisdom; for the serpent lied not when
he said, Eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,
and ye shall be as gods." And then I knew him that he
came of the devil! I cursed him, and he withdrew himself;
but he said he would come again.'</p>

<p>Leonardo listened with as much interest as if this were no
longer the delirium of sickness. He felt the gaze of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
disciple, now almost calm, but terribly accusatory, sink into
the secret depths of his soul.</p>

<p>'And the most fearsome thing,' continued Giovanni, slowly
withdrawing himself from the Master, and looking him full in
the face with fixed and piercing eyes; 'the most fearsome was
that, as he spake to me thus, he smiled. Yes, he could smile!
He smiled, as you smile upon me now&mdash;<i>you</i>!'</p>

<p>And his face became suddenly pale as wax, and with
starting eyes and contorted features, he pushed Leonardo
from him, and cried in a wild shout of terror:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Thou! Thou again! Thou hast cozened me! In the
name of God, begone. Get thee behind me, Accursed
One!'</p>

<p>At these words the Master rose, and with compelling eyes
fixed on his disciple, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Giovanni, of a truth you will do well to leave me. You
remember it is said in the Scripture, "He that feareth is not
made perfect in love." If you loved me with perfect love
you would have no fear; you would know that all this is
delusion and madness; that I am not what men suppose;
that I have no Semblance; and that, perchance, I believe more
truly in Christ my Saviour than do those who call me Antichrist.
Farewell, Giovanni.'</p>

<p>His voice shook with inexpressible bitterness, which was,
however, unresentful. He rose to go.</p>

<p>'Have I spoken truth?' he asked himself, and felt that if
his pupil could only be saved by lies, he still was unable
to lie. Boltraffio flung himself upon his knees at Leonardo's
feet.</p>

<p>'Master! pardon me. Nay, I know it is madness! I
will drive away these hideous thoughts! Only forgive me.
Let me stay!'</p>

<p>Leonardo looked at him, his eyes glistening with tenderness;
then he bent over him and kissed his brow.</p>

<p>'Then forget not, Giovanni, that you have promised!'
he exclaimed; and added calmly, 'Now let us go down; the
cold is too nipping here. I cannot leave you in this room
till you are completely cured. I have some urgent business
on hand, in which you can help me.'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>He took his disciple into his own sleeping-chamber, which
adjoined the studio, blew up the fire, and when the crackling
flame had diffused a pleasant light upon everything, bade
Giovanni prepare him a panel for a picture. He hoped that
work would calm the sick youth, nor was he mistaken;
by degrees Giovanni became completely absorbed in his
occupation.</p>

<p>With concentrated and serious attention, as if the task
were of the most curious and important in the world, he
helped the Master to soak the wood in acquavita, bi-sulphate
of arsenic and corrosive sublimate, to keep it from becoming
worm-eaten; they filled in the dents and chinks with
alabaster, cypress lac, and mastic, and smoothed the unevenness
with a plane. As usual, under the hands of Leonardo,
the work went on easily as child's play. He talked also,
and gave instruction on the making of brushes, the coarser
of pigs' bristles fixed in lead, and the finer of squirrels' hair
set in goose-quill; of varnish also, and the driers to be
used, of Venetian green and ferruginous ochre. A pleasant,
pungent, business-like scent diffused itself through the room,
and as Giovanni rubbed the panel lustily with linseed oil,
the exertion made him hot. His fever had disappeared.
Once, stopping to take breath, he looked at Leonardo, but
the latter cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Make haste! make haste! if you let it grow cold the oil
won't sink in!'</p>

<p>And Giovanni, bending his back, compressing his lips, and
straining his legs, rubbed on with increased energy and good
will.</p>

<p>'How do you feel now?' asked Leonardo.</p>

<p>'Well!' replied the other smiling.</p>

<p>The rest of the pupils gathered also in the bright room.
The comfort and warmth within was redoubled by the howl
of the wind and the patter of the rain outside. Salaino
came, shivering but light-hearted; Astro, the one-eyed
Cyclops; Jacopo and Marco; but Cesare da Sesto, as usual,
kept aloof from this friendly circle.</p>

<p>Then the panel was laid aside to dry, and Leonardo discoursed
on the purest oil for painting. An earthen dish was
brought, in which was white walnut juice covered with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
amber-coloured grease. Long coils, like lamp-wicks, were laid in it
and allowed to drip into a glass vessel.</p>

<p>'See, see!' cried Marco, 'what purity! Mine is always
turbid, however often I strain it!'</p>

<p>'Do you skin your nuts?' said Leonardo; 'if you do not,
your colours will turn black.'</p>

<p>'Then,' said Marco, 'the thin peel of a nut might ruin the
best painting in the world! Hear you, lads? you who mock
me because I carry out the Master's instructions with mathematical
rigidity!'</p>

<p>The pupils laughed and talked and jested while they
watched the preparation of the oil. It was late, but no one
cared for sleep, and without heeding the protests of Marco
the steward, they continually threw new logs upon the fire.
All were unaccountably merry.</p>

<p>'Let us tell stories,' said Andrea; and began with the tale
of the priest who on Holy Saturday took upon himself to
sprinkle a particular picture with holy water. 'Why so?'
asked its painter. 'Because it is written that for a good work
one shall receive a hundredfold,' replied the priest. And
presently, as he left the house, the painter from an upper
window poured a pail of water on his head and cried&mdash;'Here
is the hundredfold for the good you have done me in
spoiling my best picture.'</p>

<p>Other tales followed, and none enjoyed them more than
Leonardo, who indeed laughed like a child, nodding his head
and wiping tears from his eyes, and cackling with a strange
thin laugh, incongruous with his great height and powerful
build.</p>

<p>About midnight they agreed it were impossible to go to bed
without eating, especially as they had supped sparingly, for
Marco kept them on short commons. Astro brought all there
was in the pantry, some stale ham, cheese, a few olives, and
some bread. Wine there was none.</p>

<p>'Have you tilted the cask?'</p>

<p>'In all directions. There is not a drop.'</p>

<p>'Ah, Marco! Marco! what are we to do? How can we go
without wine?'</p>

<p>'Can I buy wine without money?' said Marco.</p>

<p>'There is money, and there shall be wine!' cried Jacopo,
tossing a gold piece.</p>

<p>'How got you it, imp of the devil? Marry, stealing again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
I suppose! Come here and I'll box your ears for you,' said
Leonardo, shaking his finger at him.</p>

<p>'I swear by God, Master, I did not steal it. Cut out my
tongue and send me to the pit if I did not win it at dice.'</p>

<p>'Well, stolen or not, fetch us some wine.'</p>

<p>Jacopo ran off to the Golden Eagle hard by, much frequented
by the Swiss mercenaries, and kept open all night; presently
he returned with pewter cans. The wine increased the
mirth; the little Ganymede holding the vessel high so that
beaded bubbles winked on the red liquid; and overflown
with pride in entertaining the company at his own expense,
he played pranks and jested and jumped; and mimicking the
hoarse voice of a confirmed toper, he sang the song of the
unfrocked monk:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'To the devil with cowl and with frock, oh!</p>
<p class="i1">With hood and with scapularie!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Pretty nun, the lord Abbot bemock, oh!</p>
<p class="i1">And dance at the junket with me!</p>
<p class="i6">Ha! ha! ha! Ho! ho! ho!'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>and then the solemn chorus from the Bacchanalian Mass,
written in Latin, and sung by the students on festive occasions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Who waters wine at this high feast supernal</p>
<p>&nbsp;Shall drown in it for ages sempiternal,</p>
<p>&nbsp;And after roast at fires of realms infernal!'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>They drank toasts to the Master's health, to the glory of his
studio, to the hopes of future wealth; and Giovanni never
supped so much to his liking as at this beggars' feast, on
cheese hard as rock, stale bread, and Jacopo's stolen wine.
Presently Leonardo said with a smile&mdash;</p>

<p>'I have heard, friends, that St. Francis called melancholy
the worst of sins, and preached that whoso wished to please
God must be cheerful. Let us drink to the wisdom of
Francis and to eternal cheerfulness in God.'</p>

<p>These words were surprising to all the youths except
Giovanni, who understood their intention.</p>

<p>'Eh, Master,' said Astro, shaking his head, 'it is very well
to speak of cheerfulness, but how can we be cheerful while
we crawl along the ground like grave-worms? Let the others
toast what they please, but I will drink to wings and to the
flying-machine. May the devil carry away the laws of gravity
and of mechanics which interfere with us.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
'Without mechanics you won't fly far, my friend,' said the
Master laughing.</p>

<p>After this the party broke up, and Leonardo would not
allow Giovanni to return to his cold attic; he aided him to
improvise a bed in his own room as near as might be to the
hearth, where a few cinders still glowed red.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>Giovanni had learned from Cesare that the master had all
but finished the face of the Christ in the 'Last Supper'; he
had asked several times to be allowed to see it, but Leonardo
had always postponed the matter.</p>

<p>At last, one morning he took the lad to the Refectory, and
there, in the place which had been vacant for sixteen years,
between St. John and St. James, against the square of the open
window, with the background of the quiet evening sky and
the blue hills of Zion, Giovanni saw the Christ.</p>

<p>A few days later Leonardo sent him for a rare mathematical
book to the house of the alchemist, Sacrobosco. He was
returning late in the evening. The air was frosty and still,
after a day of high wind and thaw; the pools and the ruts of
the road were coated with ice; the low clouds seemed to
cling motionless to the purple tops of the larches, in which
were a few ruined and deserted nests. Darkness came on
apace; on the dim verge of the horizon stretched the long
copper and golden streak where the sun had gone down.
The water in the Cantarana Canal, still unfrozen, seemed
heavy, black as iron, and unfathomably deep.</p>

<p>Giovanni did not own it to himself, and indeed used every
effort to suppress the thought, but he was comparing, not
without dismay, Leonardo's two renderings of the Lord's face.
If he shut his eyes, both rose before him like living things;
the one face that of a brother, and full of human weakness,
the face of Him who had agonised in bloody sweat, and prayed
a childlike prayer for a miracle; the other, superhuman, calm,
wise, alien, and terrible.</p>

<p>And Giovanni thought that, perhaps, notwithstanding their
inexplicable contradiction, the one was a likeness no less true
than the other.</p>

<p>He grew confused, as if delirium were returning, and sitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
on a stone above the black canal waters, he bowed himself in
exhaustion, and buried his head in his hands.</p>

<p>'What are you doing here, like a shade on the banks of
Acheron?' cried a mocking voice; and he felt a hand
on his shoulder, turned, and saw Cesare, like some ill-omened
ghost, in the wintry twilight; a long, lean figure,
with a long, lean, pale face, and muffled in a long grey cloak.
Giovanni rose, and they moved on together, the dead leaves
rustling under their feet.</p>

<p>'Does he know we ransacked his papers?' asked Cesare.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'And is not angered. That I expected;' and Cesare
laughed maliciously. 'Everlasting pardon, of course!'</p>

<p>There was a silence; a crow flew across the canal, cawing
hoarsely.</p>

<p>'Cesare,' said Boltraffio in a loud voice, 'have you seen
the face of the Christ in the <i>Cenacolo</i>?'</p>

<p>'I have,'</p>

<p>'And&mdash;what think you of it?'</p>

<p>'What think <i>you</i>?' said Cesare, turning abruptly to his
companion.</p>

<p>'I can hardly say; but it seems to me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Speak frankly. It does not satisfy you?'</p>

<p>'That is not what I mean. But it seems to me, perhaps,
that it is not Christ.'</p>

<p>'Not Christ? Who then else?'</p>

<p>Giovanni did not reply; his eyes were on the ground,
and without knowing it, his pace slackened. At last he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>'That other sketch in coloured chalk, the young Christ&mdash;have
you seen that?'</p>

<p>'Yes. A Jewish boy with chestnut curls, full lips and
a low brow; the son of old Barucco. You like it better?'</p>

<p>'No. But I was thinking how little alike they are, those
two pictures!'</p>

<p>'Little alike? But it is the same face&mdash;fifteen years older,
that is all! However, it may be you are right. They may be
two Christs, but as like each other as a man and his own
phantom.'</p>

<p>'As a man and his own phantom!' echoed Giovanni,
shuddering and stopping. 'What say you, Cesare? A man
and his own phantom?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
'Well, what is so alarming in those words? Don't you
agree with me?'</p>

<p>They walked on.</p>

<p>'Cesare!' cried Boltraffio suddenly and impulsively, 'do
you not see what I mean? How could He, the Omnipotent,
the Omniscient, whom Leonardo has painted in the <i>Cenacolo</i>,
how could He have been tortured on the Mount of Olives,
not a stone's throw away, till He sweated blood and prayed
a human prayer for a miracle? "Let not that take place,
to accomplish which I came into the world, that which I
know cannot fail to be! Father, let this cup pass from me!"
Cesare, everything is contained in that prayer! Without it
there is no Christ, and I would not relinquish it for all the
wisdom of Solomon! The Christ who prayed not that prayer
was never a man; He did not suffer and die like us!'</p>

<p>'I see your meaning,' replied Cesare slowly; 'certainly the
Christ of the <i>Cenacolo</i> never prayed that prayer.'</p>

<p>The darkness was falling around them, and Giovanni could
not accurately see the face of his companion, which, however,
seemed strangely illuminated. Suddenly Cesare stopped,
raised his hand, and spoke in a low solemn voice.</p>

<p>'You wish to know whom he has painted, if 'tis not
the weaker Christ who prayed for a hopeless miracle in the
garden of Gethsemane? Well, I will tell you. Remember
that beautiful invocation of Leonardo's when he spoke of
the laws of the mechanical sciences, "O divine justice of
Thee, Thou Prime Mover!" His Christ is the Prime
Mover, who, principle and centre of every movement, is
Himself moveless. His Christ is the eternal necessity, which
is divine justice, which is the Father's will. "O righteous
Father, the world hath not known Thee, but I have known
Thee and I have declared unto these Thy name, that the
love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them,
and I in them." Do you see? Love born of knowledge.
'<i>Grande amore è figlio di grande sapienza.</i>' Great love is the
child of great knowledge. And Leonardo, who alone of men
has understood this saying of the Lord's, has incarnated it in
his Christ, who loves all because he knows all.'</p>

<p>Cesare ceased, and for long they walked silently in the
profound calm of the winter twilight. At last Boltraffio
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Do you remember, Cesare, how four years ago, you and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
I, walking along this path together, were discussing the
Cenacolo? Then you mocked at the Master, and said he
would never finish the face of the Christ, and I contradicted
you. Now it is you who defend him against me. Of a
surety I should never have believed that you&mdash;<i>you</i>! would
one day speak of him as now you have spoken!'</p>

<p>And Giovanni tried to see his companion's face, but the
other turned away.</p>

<p>'Now, I see with joy, Cesare, that you also love him! Yes,
you love him, you who wish to hate him; you love him
perhaps better than do I!'</p>

<p>'Did you imagine anything else?' replied Cesare, slowly
turning to his companion a pale moved face; 'and yet I
would indeed be glad to hate him, but instead I must love
him, for he has done, in the 'Last Supper,' what no one has
ever done, what perhaps he himself does not understand so
well as I&mdash;I, his most mortal enemy.' And Cesare laughed
a forced laugh. 'How odd is the human heart!' he went on.
'I will confess the truth, Giovanni; perhaps I love him less
to-day than I did at the time you have alluded to.'</p>

<p>'Why so, Cesare?'</p>

<p>'Perchance because I value my own individuality. To be
lowest among the lowest&mdash;yes, better that than to be but
a member of his body, a toe of his foot! Let Marco find
contentment in ladles for the measuring out of paint, and
rules for the proportions of noses. <i>I</i> should like to ask with
which of these Leonardo made that countenance of Christ!
True, he does his best to teach us, poor chickens, to fly like
eagles from the eagles' nest; for he is compassionate, and
sorry for us, as he is sorry for the blind pups in the yard, or
for a lame horse, or for the criminal whom he accompanies
to execution that he may watch his dying convulsions. Like
the sun, he shines upon everything. Only, see you, my friend,
each man hath his own fancy; you may like to be the worm
which, in St. Francis' fashion, Leonardo lifts from the highway
and sets on a green twig; I'd sooner be crushed by him!'</p>

<p>'Then, Cesare, if you feel thus, why do you not leave
him?'</p>

<p>'And you&mdash;why do <i>you</i> not leave him? You have burnt
your wings like a moth in a candle, and still you flutter
round the flame. Perchance I also am fain to burn myself
in that flame. Yet, maybe, one hope remains to me!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
'What hope?'</p>

<p>'A foolish hope. The dream of a madman! Yet I often
dwell upon it. The hope that one day a man shall arise,
unlike him, yet his equal; not Perugino, nor Borgognone,
nor Botticelli, nor the great Mantegna&mdash;Leonardo surpasses
all these; but another, one who is still unknown, reserved
for a later day. I would fain see the glory of this new one
immense! I would fain look in the face of Messer Leonardo
and remind him that even a spared worm like me can prefer
another to him, can be pleased in the humiliation of his pride;
for, Giovanni, he is proud as Lucifer, in spite of his lamb-like
meekness and his universal charity.'</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly, and Giovanni felt his hand tremble.</p>

<p>'Hark you, Giovanni,' he said in a changed voice, 'who
told you I loved him? You never guessed it?'</p>

<p>'He told me himself.'</p>

<p>'He? Then he believes&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>His voice broke. Nothing remained to be said, and each
was lost in his own thoughts, his own griefs. At the next
cross-road they parted.</p>

<p>Giovanni, with eyes on the ground, walked mechanically
along the narrow path skirting the canal in whose dark
waters no star was reflected. He repeated to himself, scarce
consciously, 'As like as a man and his own phantom! His
own phantom!'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>XV</h3>

<p>At the beginning of March 1499, and at the moment when he
least expected it, Leonardo received his salary, which had been
for two years unpaid. It was reported at this time that Il
Moro, overwhelmed by the news of the alliance concluded
against him by the Doge of Venice, the Pope, and the King
of France, intended to flee to the German Emperor upon the
first appearance in Lombardy of the French forces; and that
it was in order to secure the fidelity of his subjects during his
absence that he lightened the taxes, paid his creditors, and
heaped largesses upon his friends. A little later Leonardo
received a fresh mark of his patron's favour: the gift of sixteen
perches of vineyard land, acquired from the monastery
of San Vittore near the Porta Vercellina, 'which,' so ran the
deed of gift, 'Ludovico Maria Sforza, Duke of Milan, confers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
on Leonardo da Vinci, the Florentine, most famous of
painters.'</p>

<p>Leonardo went to express his thanks to the Duke, and was
not granted an interview till very late in the evening, owing
to the pressure of state affairs. Il Moro had passed the
whole day in tedious conversation with secretaries and
treasurers, in verifying accounts for munition of war, in
loosing old knots and tying new ones in that web of deceit
and treachery, which had pleased him well when he had been
the spidery master of the threads, but which was another
matter now he found himself in the position of a fly.</p>

<p>His business despatched, the Duke went to the Gallery of
Bramante, which looked down upon the castle moat. The
stillness of the night was broken at times by the blare
of a trumpet, by the challenge of sentinels, by the clank of
the drawbridge chains. As soon as he had entered the
gallery, his page, Ricciardetto, fixed torches in iron sconces
against the wall, and handed his master a gold platter with
small pieces of bread. These Ludovico threw to the swans
which, attracted by the reflection from the windows, had
come sailing over the black mirror of the water in the moat.
Isabella d'Este, his lost Beatrice's sister, had sent him these
swans from Mantua, where the flat shores of the Mincio, thick
with reeds and willow-trees, were a renowned breeding-place
for great flocks of these beautiful birds. Feeding them was
his chief recreation after the business and anxieties of the day.
They reminded him of his childhood, by the weed-grown pools
of Vigevano; and here in the gloomy castle moat, among
frowning embrasured walls, high towers, cannon balls, and
bombards, the noiseless snow-white creatures, gliding like
phantoms through the silver moonlit mist upon the scarce
visible water in which stars were reflected, seemed to him full
of mystery and charm.</p>

<p>Leaning out of the window, and still absorbed in his
amusement, the Duke did not hear the creak of a small door,
nor notice the approach of a chamberlain, until, with a deep
reverence, the man had handed him a paper.</p>

<p>'What is this?' asked the Duke.</p>

<p>'Messer Borgonzio Botta sends your Excellency the account
for munition of war, powder and bullets; he is grieved that
he must trouble your lordship, but at dawn the convoy starts
for Mortara.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
Il Moro snatched the paper angrily, crumpled it, and threw
it aside.</p>

<p>'How many times have I said I transact no business after
supper? Good God! soon I shall not be allowed even to
sleep!'</p>

<p>The chamberlain, still bowing, retreated backwards,
announcing in a low voice which the Duke need not hear
unless it so minded him:</p>

<p>'Messer Leonardo.'</p>

<p>'Leonardo! Why not have brought him in before?
Conduct him hither at once.'</p>

<p>And returning to the feeding of his swans, he added to
himself, 'Leonardo will not worry me!'</p>

<p>When the painter entered, Il Moro smiled at him much as
he smiled at his pets; and when Leonardo would have knelt,
restrained him, and kissed his forehead.</p>

<p>'Welcome! 'Tis long since I have seen you. How fare
you, friend?'</p>

<p>'I have to thank your Excellency&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Enough! Enough! You are worthy of better gifts.
Give me time, and I will recompense you properly.'</p>

<p>Then they talked of the diving-bell, the shoes for walking
the water, the wings. But when Leonardo would have diverted
the conversation to business, to the fortifications, the Martesana
Canal, the casting of the great <i>Cavallo</i>, Ludovico evaded
the subject with an air of disgust. Suddenly, as if remembering
something, he fell into a fit of abstraction, oblivious of his
companion's presence, sitting quite silent, with eyes on the
ground, and Leonardo, supposing himself dismissed, would
have taken his leave. The Duke nodded absently, but when
the painter had reached the door he recalled him, and laying
both his hands on his shoulders, looked at him with a long
sad gaze.</p>

<p>'Farewell, my Leonardo. Who knows if ever again we shall
see each other, we two alone, face to face, as at this minute!'</p>

<p>'Is your Excellency going to abandon us?'</p>

<p>Il Moro sighed heavily and paused before replying.</p>

<p>'We have been together for sixteen years,' he said at last,
'and in all that time I have never disapproved you, nor,
I think, have you disapproved me. The vulgar may murmur;
yet I think in after ages, when they speak of Leonardo,
they will have a good word for Il Moro, his friend.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
The painter, who did not like outbursts of tenderness,
replied in the one courtly phrase which he reserved for
moments of necessity:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I would I had more than a single life to dedicate to the
service of your Highness.'</p>

<p>'I believe it,' said Ludovico; 'some day, Leonardo,
perhaps you will remember me, and will weep&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>And himself scarcely restraining a sob, he embraced him,
kissing his lips.</p>

<p>'Leave me now, and may God go with you!' he said; and
after Leonardo had gone he remained long in the Bramante
Gallery, where no sound broke the stillness save the slow
droppings from the torches, watching his swans, and thinking
strange thoughts. He fancied that across his dark, and even
criminal, life Leonardo had passed like these white swans
across the black waters of the castle moat, under those
embrasured walls, towers, and magazines; Leonardo, useless
as they, delightful, immaculate, and pure.</p>

<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>Late as was the hour, the artist, having left the Duke, went
to the Convento of Saint Francis to inquire for his pupil,
Giovanni Boltraffio, who was lying there grievously sick of
a brain fever.</p>

<p>Visiting his former teacher, Fra Benedetto, in December
1498, Giovanni had found Fra Paolo, a Dominican from
Florence, with him, and this man had given them the account
of Savonarola's death.</p>

<p>The execution&mdash;thus Fra Paolo related&mdash;had been
appointed for nine of a May morning, to take place in
the Piazza della Signoria, exactly where had been the
burning of vanities and the ordeal by fire. A pyre was
raised at the end of a long platform; and above it a
gibbet&mdash;a stout beam driven into the ground, with a crosspiece,
from which dangled three halters and iron chains.
No effort of the carpenters could prevent this erection from
looking like a cross. The square, the loggias, the windows
and roofs of the houses were thronged by as great a multitude
as had assembled for the trial by fire. The condemned&mdash;Fra
Girolamo Savonarola, Fra Domenico da Pescia, and Fra
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
Silvestro Maruffi&mdash;issued from the Palazzo Vecchio, advanced
along the platform and stood before the Bishop of Pagagliotti,
the papal nuncio. The bishop rose, took Savonarola's hand,
and in trembling tones, not daring to meet the unfaltering
gaze of the monk, he pronounced the ritual of degradation.
Almost hesitatingly he uttered the concluding words: '<i>Separo
te ab Ecclesia militante atque triumphante</i>.' (I cut you off from
the Church militant and triumphant.)</p>

<p>To which Fra Girolamo replied:&mdash;'<i>Militante, non triumphante;
hoc enim tuum non est.</i>' (From the Church militant,
yes; from the Church triumphant, no; that is not within
your power!)</p>

<p>The three brothers were unfrocked; then, covered merely
with their under-tunics, they advanced further and stood
before the tribune of the Apostolic Commissaries who
pronounced them heretics and schismatics; and then again
before the '<i>Otto Uomini della Repubblica Fiorentina</i>' (The
Eight of the Florentine Republic), who solemnly, in the name
of the people, pronounced the death sentence. During this
last progress, Fra Silvestro stumbled and nearly fell, and
Fra Domenico and Savonarola likewise were seen to totter.
Later it was discovered that this was due to a jest of certain
of the Sacred Troop of Youthful Inquisitors, who had crept
under the planks and run nails through them, so as to
wound the naked feet of the condemned.</p>

<p>Fra Silvestro, the imbecile, was the first taken to the
scaffold. With his customary apathetic expression, seemingly
unconscious of what was befalling him, he ascended the
steps; yet when the hangman put the noose upon his neck
he cried, raising his eyes to heaven: 'Lord, into Thy hands I
commend my spirit.' And not waiting for the executioner's
thrust, he leaped deliberately and fearlessly from the ladder.
Then Fra Domenico, who had expected his turn with joyous
impatience, immediately on receiving the signal, sprang to
the scaffold smiling ecstatically as if summoned to Paradise.</p>

<p>Fra Silvestro's body hung from one end of the crossbeam,
Fra Domenico's from the other; the centre was for
Savonarola. As he neared the place, he stood still, and
looked down upon the crowd. Then there was a silence,
profound as once in the Cathedral of Santa Maria del
Fiore, when his expectant followers awaited the commencement
of his preaching. But now he said no word; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
halter was adjusted; then a voice called out (and no one
knew if it were mockery or the wild cry of agonising faith):
'Perform a miracle, O prophet! Perform a miracle!' But
the executioner had already swung off the martyr from the
ladder.</p>

<p>Then an old workman, whose face was resigned yet full
of ascetic fervour, and who for several days had had the
custody of the pyre, crossed himself hurriedly and threw
the lighted torch upon the pile, ejaculating, as Savonarola
had done when he had set fire to the 'vanities and
anathemata'&mdash;'In the name of the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost!'</p>

<p>The flames leaped into the air; but the wind blew strongly
and drove them in the contrary direction from the scaffold.
Wherefore the crowd, smitten with a sudden fear, fell into
tumult, and swayed hither and thither, pressing upon and
trampling one another, and bursting into the cry: 'They burn
not! Lo! a miracle! a miracle!' But the wind fell and the
flames rose straight and high, and licked round Fra Girolamo's
corpse. And the cord wherewith his hands had been tied was
sundered by the fire, and the hands fell loose and dropped
and moved in the flame; and to many of the people it seemed
that for the last time he blessed them.</p>

<p>When the fire was spent, and of the three brothers there
remained only charred bones and morsels of blackened flesh
quivering on the iron chains, then the faithful pressed forward
and would have collected relics of the martyrs. But
the guards, driving them away, piled the ashes into a cart
and took them to the Ponte Vecchio with intent to cast
them into the river. And on the way thither the Piagnoni
succeeded in snatching some few handfuls of the sacred
ashes, and certain rags of flesh which they believed to have
been the heart of their murdered prophet.</p>

<p>Fra Paolo ended his recital; and he showed his hearers
a little purse in which he had saved some of these sacred
ashes. Fra Benedetto kissed it again and again, watering it
with his tears; then the two monks went together to vespers.
When they returned to the cell, they found Giovanni lying
senseless on the ground before the crucifix, clutching the
little casket of ashes in his frozen fingers.</p>

<p>For three months the young man lay between life and
death; and Fra Benedetto never left him day nor night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
He was long delirious, and the good monk shuddered as
he listened to his wanderings. He raved of Savonarola,
of Leonardo, of that blessed Mother of God, who, drawing
with her finger on the sand of the desert, taught the divine
Child geometrical figures and the laws of eternal necessity.</p>

<p>'For what dost Thou pray?' the sick man would repeat
with unutterable grief: 'Knowest Thou not that there is no
relief&mdash;no miracle&mdash;? The cup cannot pass from Thee;
even as a straight line cannot fail to be the shortest way
between two points.'</p>

<p>He was haunted by the vision of the two faces of the
Lord, unlike, yet like as a man and his own phantom; the
one overborne with human woe and weakness, who in His
agony had prayed for a miracle; the other the face of the
Omnipotent, of the Omniscient; of the Word made flesh,
of the Prime Mover. They were turned towards each other
like irreconcilable and eternal foes. And while Giovanni
gazed at them, gradually the one Face, that of the Lamb
of God, gentle, sorrowful, long-suffering, became obscured;
and changed into the face of the demon which Leonardo had
once drawn, caricaturing Savonarola. And this demon-face,
denouncing the semblance of the Omnipotent, named him
Antichrist.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fra Benedetto's loving care saved the life of his adopted
son. By the beginning of June Giovanni had so far recovered
as to be able to walk; and then, notwithstanding all the
warnings and the entreaties of the affectionate monk, he
returned to Leonardo's studio.</p>

<p>Towards the close of July the army of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span> of
France, commanded by Marshal d'Aubigny, Louis of Luxemburg,
and Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, crossed the Alps and
burst down upon the plains of Lombardy.</p>

<h3 class="p2">I</h3>

<p>The Duke's treasury, a subterranean chamber very long and
narrow and piled with huge oak chests, was entered from the
north-west tower of the Rocchetta by a small iron door set
in the thickness of the wall and adorned with an unfinished
painting by Leonardo. On the first night of September
1499, Messer Ambrogio Ferrari the court treasurer, and
Messer Borgonzio Botta the comptroller of the ducal revenue,
with their assistants, shovelled coins, pearls, and other
treasures hastily from the oak chests, threw them into leathern
bags, which they sealed with the ducal seal, and consigned to
servants to be packed upon mules. Already two hundred
and forty bags had been sealed and thirty mules had been
loaded, yet the guttering candles still showed that the chests
contained great heaps of silver. Il Moro, meanwhile, sat at
a portable writing-desk heaped with registers and account-books,
but gazed blankly at the flame of the candle, and
paid no attention to the work of the treasurers. Since the
terrible news had reached him of the defeat of Galeazzo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
Sanseverino, the commander of his forces, and of the inevitable
nearing of the French, he seemed to have fallen into
some strange torpor which resembled insensibility.</p>

<p>Presently Ambrogio Ferrari inquired whether the Duke
wished to take the gold and silver plate also; but Ludovico,
after frowning and apparently making an effort to attend,
turned away, waved his hand, and once more fixed his eyes
upon the candle. The question was repeated, but this
time he did not even feign attention; and presently the
treasurers, unable to obtain an answer, went away. Il Moro
remained alone.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the old chamberlain announced
Messer Bernardino da Corte, the newly appointed commandant
of the fortress. The Duke roused himself, passed
his hand over his brow, and bade his approach.</p>

<p>Ludovico, distrustful of the scions of great families, liked
raising men from nothing, making the first last, and the
last first. This Bernardino was the son of a footman, and
had himself in his boyhood worn the court livery. The Duke
had, however, exalted him to the highest offices of state, and
now, as a proof of final confidence in his ability and good
faith, had charged him with the defence of the castle of
Milan, his last stronghold.</p>

<p>The Duke received the new governor graciously, bade him
sit, spread before him the plan of the castle, explained the
signals concerted between the fortress and the town. For
example, in the daytime a curved gardening knife (or at
night a flaming torch) displayed from the main tower of the
castle was to show the need for instant help; a white sheet,
hung on the tower of Bona, signified treachery within the
walls; a chair suspended by a rope meant lack of powder;
a petticoat, lack of wine; a pair of breeches, scarcity of
bread; an earthenware pot, the need of a doctor.</p>

<p>Il Moro had himself invented this code, and was childishly
pleased with it, as if in it lay somehow his chief hope of
safety.</p>

<p>'Remember, Bernardino,' thus he concluded his exordium,
'everything has been foreseen. You have sufficiency of
money, powder, provisions, fire-arms; the three thousand
mercenaries are already paid; the fortress is in your hands,
and should be able to stand a three years' siege. I, however,
only ask you to hold it for three months; if at the end of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
time I have not returned to your relief, you must do what
you think best. Now you know all. Farewell, my son; may
the Lord protect you!' And he favoured him with an
embrace.</p>

<p>The governor of the castle dismissed, Il Moro bade the
page prepare his camp bed. He prayed, and laid himself
down, but sleep proved impossible. He lighted a candle,
took a packet of papers from his wallet, and found a poem
by one Antonio Cammelli da Pistoia, Bellincioni's rival, who
on the first appearance of the French had deserted his patron.
The poem represented the war between Ludovico and
Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span> as a conflict between a winged serpent and a
cock:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Italia's lord, we lay to heart thy fate,</p>
<p>&nbsp;For good it is to learn by other men's undoing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;O bitter word to speak, the loss of all things rueing&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;When fickle fortune smiled, I was a potentate!</p>
<p>&nbsp;The world to Ludovico seemed a fief but late;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Itself and all its glory appeared but of his doing;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Yet Heav'n, his stomach high and proud presumption viewing,</p>
<p>&nbsp;His every hope and scheme did suddenly frustrate.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Duke's soul was pervaded by melancholy, which was
not, however, entirely disagreeable. It was partly the pride
of a martyr. He remembered the servility of the sonnets
the same poet had dedicated to him not long ago:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Speak, potent lord, and say, The world to me is given!'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was midnight, and the flame of the dying candle flickered
and grew dim, but still the Duke continued to pace the
gloomy room, thinking of his griefs, of the injustice of blind
fortune, of the ingratitude of men.</p>

<p>'What wrong have I done them? Why do they hate me?
They call me a villain and an assassin; but what have I done
more than Romulus who killed his brother, and Cæsar, and
Alexander, and all the heroes of antiquity? Were <i>they</i>
villains and assassins? My desire was to give them a new
age of gold, such as had not been seen since the days of
Augustus and the Antonines. A little longer, and under my
rule Italy would have been united; the laurels of Apollo
would have bloomed, and the olives of Pallas; the reign of
peace would have begun, and the worship of the muses.
First among princes, I sought greatness not in deeds of war,
but in the fruits of golden peace, in the protection of talent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Bramante, Pacioli, Caradosso, Leonardo, and how many others!
In days to come, when the noise of arms shall be forgotten,
their names will be remembered, together with the name of
Sforza. To what a height should not I, the new Pericles,
have raised my new Athens, but for this horde of northern
barbarians who have cut short my work? Why, O my God
<i>why</i> is this permitted?'</p>

<p>And, his head drooping on his breast, he thought again of
the lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'O bitter word to speak, the loss of all things rueing&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;When fickle fortune smiled, I was a potentate!'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The candle flared for the last time, illuminating the
vaulting of the roof, and the fresco of Mercury above the
treasure-house door. Then it sank down and went out.
The Duke shuddered, for he thought it a bad omen. Fearful
of awakening Ricciardetto, he groped his way to the bed, lay
down again, and this time fell asleep at once.</p>

<p>He dreamed that he knelt to Madonna Beatrice, who
having discovered his intrigue with Lucrezia was taxing him
with it, and striking him full in the face. He was pained, yet
rejoiced that she had returned to life. He submitted to her
chastisement, caught her hands that he might kiss them, and
wept for love. But suddenly there stood before him, not
Beatrice, but the Mercury of Leonardo's fresco over the door.
The god seized him by the hair, crying:&mdash;</p>

<p>'O fool, and blind! In what dost thou yet hope? Will
all your deceits save you from the just punishment of God?
Murderer and villain!'</p>

<p>When he awoke, the morning light was shining on the
windows. The lords, the knights, the captains, the German
mercenaries, who were to escort him to the court of
Maximilian, in all, some three thousand horsemen, were
awaiting his presence by the main road which led north&mdash;towards
the Alps.</p>

<p>Ludovico mounted, and rode to the Monastery delle
Grazie, that he might pray for the last time beside the grave
of his lost Beatrice. Later, when the sun was high in the
heavens, the cortège began its march through Como, Bellaggio,
Bormio, Bolzano, and Brisina, to the Tyrol, and the city of
Innsbrück.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The journey took over a fortnight, for a rainy autumn had
spoiled the roads. On the 18th of September, the Duke,
being fatigued and indisposed, determined to pass the night
in a mountain cave, which afforded shelter to a few herdsmen.
It would not have been difficult to find a more commodious
resting-place, but Il Moro deliberately chose this wild spot
for his reception of the ambassador from Maximilian. The
watch-fires illumined the stalactites and the natural vaulting
of the cavern; pheasants were roasting for supper; and the
Duke, seated on a camp-chair, his feet on a brazier, and his
head muffled&mdash;for he was suffering from toothache&mdash;reflected,
not without a certain satisfaction, on the greatness of his
misfortunes. Lucrezia Crivelli, bright and gentle as ever,
was preparing an anodyne of wine, pepper, cloves, and other
potent spices for the illustrious sufferer.</p>

<p>'So, then, Messer Odoardo,' said Il Moro to the Emperor's
envoy,' you can tell his Majesty where, and in what condition
you found the legitimate ruler of Lombardy.'</p>

<p>Ludovico was in one of the fits of loquacity which sometimes
succeeded to long periods of silence and dejection.
'Foxes have holes,' he went on, 'and birds of the air have
nests, but I have not where to lay my head. Corio,' he
turned to the chronicler, 'in compiling your annals omit not
description of this lodging, the refuge of the last heir of the
great Sforzas, of the descendant of Anglus, the Trojan, the
comrade of Æneas.'</p>

<p>'My lord,' said Odoardo, 'your misfortunes deserve the
pen of a new Tacitus.'</p>

<p>Lucrezia brought the anodyne, and the Duke paused to
look at her admiringly. Her pale clear face was bright in
the rosy glow of the firelight, her black hair coiled smoothly
above her pure forehead, upon which glowed the single
diamond of the <i>ferroniera</i>. She looked at her lover with her
grave, innocent, and observant eyes; on her lips was a smile
of almost maternal tenderness.</p>

<p>'Sweet heart!' thought Ludovico, 'here is one who will never
betray me!' and receiving the medicament from her hand, he
again turned to the chronicler and said, with swelling sententiousness:
'Corio, set down likewise this; "true friendship is
proved in the furnace of affliction, as gold is proved in the fire."'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
'Eh, old fellow, why so gloomy?' cried Janachi, seating
himself at the Duke's feet, and slapping his knee, 'a truce to
this black bile! There's remedy for every ill save death,
and trust me, old man, it's better to be a living ass than a
dead prince! Kiki riki! Look! look! what a throng of ass-saddles
we have here!'</p>

<p>'Well, what of it?' asked the Duke, wearily.</p>

<p><i>'Moro mio, moro mio</i>, there's an old Story which says&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;go on; relate the story!'</p>

<p>The fool jumped to his feet, ringing his bells and shaking
his rattle.</p>

<p>'Once upon a time there was a king in Naples, and
he bade Giotto the painter make him a wall-picture of
his kingdom. And the saucy painter drew a stout Ass
carrying on his back a Saddle with the royal arms, the
sceptre, and the crown; and the Ass was sniffing at another
Saddle, also emblazoned with arms, sceptre and crown.
Wherefore, dear Sir, I say to thee, to-day the people of Milan
are sniffing at the French Saddle. Let them alone! Soon
enough will it gall their backs, and they'll wish to be quit of it!'</p>

<p>'<i>Stulti aliquando sapientes</i>,' said the Duke, with a melancholy
smile at this piece of imbecility. 'Corio, write in the
chronicle&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>But he did not finish the phrase, for the snorting of horses,
the tramp of hoofs, and the buzz of voices were heard outside
the cavern. Mariolo Pusterla the chamberlain, his face pale
and agitated, entered hastily, and whispered with Calco the
chief secretary.</p>

<p>'What has happened?' asked the Duke.</p>

<p>No one was willing to reply, and all eyes fell.</p>

<p>'Your Excellency&mdash;&mdash;' began the secretary, in trembling
tones, and broke off.</p>

<p>'May the Lord support your Excellency!' said Luigi
Marliani. 'Be prepared; bad news has arrived from Milan.'</p>

<p>'Speak, then; speak! For God's sake, speak!' cried
Ludovico, turning pale. Then looking towards the entrance,
he caught sight of a man splashed with mud, and travel-worn.
The Duke brushed Marliani aside, hurried to the
messenger, and snatching a letter from his hand, broke the
seal, read with lightning glance, uttered a cry, and sank
senseless to the ground. Marliani and Pusterla were barely
in time to break his fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
On the 17th of September, the feast of San Satiro, the
traitor Bernardino da Corte had opened the gates of the
Castle of Milan to the French marshal, Gian Giacomo
Trivulzio.</p>

<p>Ludovico was practised in the simulation of diplomatic
faintness. This time, however, the physicians had trouble in
restoring him to consciousness. When at last he regained
his senses, he sighed, made the sign of the cross, and
murmured:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Since Judas there never was a traitor like Bernardino da
Corte.'</p>

<p>And for the rest of the evening he did not utter a single
word.</p>

<p>A few days later the Duke arrived at Innsbrück, where he
was graciously received by the Emperor and lodged in the
imperial palace. One evening he was walking up and down
his chamber, and dictating to Bartolomeo Calco credentials
for the envoys whom he was secretly despatching to the
Sultan. The face of the old secretary expressed nothing but
attention, and his pen travelled rapidly over the paper, as
the words fell from his master's lips.</p>

<p>'"Firm and invariable in our good disposition towards your
Highness"'&mdash;so ran the document&mdash;'"and trusting that in
the task of recovering our lost dominions, we may look for
aid to the magnanimity of the powerful ruler of the Ottoman
Empire, we have resolved to send three different messengers
by three different roads, so that at least one of them may
arrive and present our letter. The Pope, who by nature is
perfidious and wicked&mdash;&mdash;"'</p>

<p>Here the pen of the dispassionate secretary stopped; he
looked up, wrinkling his brows. He could not believe his
ears.</p>

<p>'The Pope?'</p>

<p>'Yes, the Pope. Go on,'</p>

<p>The secretary looked at his work again, and the pen
scratched faster than before.</p>

<p>'"The Pope, being by nature wicked and perfidious, has
instigated the French king to carry war into Lombardy."'</p>

<p>Then came the list of French victories.</p>

<p>'"Dismayed by these misfortunes,"' continued Il Moro
frankly, '"we have judged it prudent to seek refuge at the court
of the Emperor Maximilian, while awaiting the assistance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
your Highness. All have betrayed us; but more than the
rest, Bernardino"'&mdash;here his voice shook&mdash;'"Bernardino
da Corte, a serpent warmed in our bosom, a slave whom we
had heaped with favours and benefactions; a traitor like
unto Judas"&mdash;Nay, 'tis vain to speak of Judas to an infidel;
scratch out "Judas."'</p>

<p>He prayed the Sultan to assail Venice by sea and by land,
assuring him of easy victory and the complete destruction of
that secular enemy of the Ottomans, the arrogant Republic
of St. Mark.</p>

<p>'"And we pray your Highness to remember,"' he concluded,
'"that in this war, as in every other undertaking,
all we have is at the disposal of your Highness, who in all
Europe will find no more faithful ally than Ourselves."'</p>

<p>He had approached the table and seemed desirous of
adding yet another few words; but in a sudden access of
discouragement he waved his hand, and threw himself on a
seat. Calco carefully strewed the wet writing with sand;
then he looked up and saw that the Duke had covered his
face with his hands, and was weeping, his shoulders shaking
with sobs.</p>

<p>'Lord, why hast thou permitted this? Where, where is
Thine eternal justice?' he mourned. Then uncovering his
distorted face, which at that moment seemed to belong to
some feeble old woman, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Bartolomeo, you know that I repose confidence in you.
Tell me, on your conscience, am I acting wisely?'</p>

<p>'Does your Excellency refer to the embassy to the Grand
Turk?'</p>

<p>Il Moro nodded.</p>

<p>The old man wrinkled his forehead and puffed his lips
meditatively.</p>

<p>'Certes, those who hunt with wolves must howl with them;
yet if we look at the matter from another point of view&mdash;in
fine, if I am permitted to counsel your Excellency, I would
say, wait!'</p>

<p>'I have waited. Now I will demonstrate that the Duke of
Milan is not to be tossed aside like a mere pawn. My friend,
I have been ever on the side of right, and I have been most
iniquitously abused. Who shall blame me if I appeal, not
only to the Grand Turk, but to the very devil himself?'</p>

<p>'Yet an invasion by the infidel,' suggested the secretary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
'might perchance be cause of grave peril to the Christian
Church.'</p>

<p>'God forbid, Bartolomeo! I have considered that. I
would suffer a thousand deaths rather than bring damage to
our holy Mother Church. But hark you! You do not fully
understand my design.'</p>

<p>At these words his lips took on their old rapacious smile.
'We will brew these villains such a broth,' he continued; 'we
will entangle them in such nets, that none of them shall look
again on God's world! But the Grand Turk!&mdash;why, the Grand
Turk is no more than a tool in my hands! When the time is
ripe we will cast him aside, and then we will root out all that
vile sect of Mahometans, and free the sacred sepulchre of the
Lord from the unclean domination of infidel dogs!'</p>

<p>Calco discreetly lowered his eyes and made no answer.</p>

<p>'This is bad,' he said to himself; 'these are dreams; in all
this there is no policy. He lets himself be carried too far,
and he perceives not consequences.'</p>

<p>But that night Ludovico, animated by hope in God and in
the Grand Turk, prayed long before his favourite picture,
by Leonardo, in which the Virgin was pourtrayed with the
features and smile of Cecilia, Countess Bergamini.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Ten days before the surrender of the castle, the French
marshal, Trivulzio, had made entry into Milan amid the
pealing of bells and the acclamation of the populace.
The king's entry was fixed for the 6th of October, and the
citizens were preparing for his reception. The two great
angels which, fifty years earlier in the days of the 'Repubblica
Ambrosiana,' had represented the genii of popular liberty,
were taken from the cathedral treasury for use in the royal
procession. Long disuse had stiffened the springs by which
their gilded wings were moved, and they were accordingly
sent for repair to the court mechanician, Leonardo da Vinci.
</p><p>
Early one autumnal morning, while it was still dark,
Leonardo sat at his desk, busy with his calculations and
his geometrical designs. Of late he had resumed his study
of aerostatics, and was constructing another flying-machine.
Its skeleton was spread across the room, not, like its predecessor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
resembling a bat, but rather a gigantic swallow. One
of the wings was completed; slender, sharply outlined,
beautiful in form and texture, it rose from floor to ceiling,
and under its shadow Astro was working at the two wooden
angels of the former Milanese Republic. In this latest
apparatus Leonardo had determined to follow, as closely as
he might, the structure of those winged creatures which
nature had provided as models for a flying-machine. He still
hoped to solve the problem by close observance of mechanical
laws; but though apparently he knew all that could be known,
there was still something which eluded his comprehension,
and which perhaps lay outside these laws with which he was
so familiar. As in his earlier experiments, he found himself
brought up against that subtle dividing line which separates
the creations of nature from the work of human hands; the
structure of the living body from the structure of the lifeless
machine; and he began to think he was aiming at the impossible&mdash;the
irrational.
</p><p>
'Thank God, that is finished!' exclaimed Astro, winding
up the springs of the wooden angels.
</p><p>
Their heavy wings moved, and in the resultant waft of air,
the delicate wing of the great swallow stirred and rustled.
The smith looked at it with inexpressible tenderness.
</p><p>
'The time I have squandered on these stupid monsters!'
he exclaimed, pushing the angels away. 'From this out,
Master, you may say what you please, but I will not go from
this room till I have finished my swallow! Give me, pr'ythee,
the design for the tail.'
</p><p>
'It is not ready, Astro. It demands further calculation.'
</p><p>
'But, Master, you promised it to me three days ago!'
</p><p>
'It cannot be helped. The tail of our bird is the rudder.
The smallest mistake will ruin the whole.'
</p><p>
'You know best, I suppose! I will get on with the second
wing.'
</p><p>
'We had better wait. It may be necessary to introduce
some modification.'
</p><p>
The smith very carefully lifted the cane skeleton, overlaid
with a network of bullocks' tendons; he turned it round, and
contemplated it under every aspect. Then, his voice thick
and trembling with excitement, he cried:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Master, be not wroth, but hear! If your calculations lead
you to the conclusion that this machine also is useless, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
swear to you that none the less <i>I</i> intend to fly. Yes, I will
fly in spite of all your damnable mechanics. I have no
longer patience for waiting, because&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
He stopped short. Leonardo gazed at the wide, irregular,
obstinate face, impressed with a single, senseless, all-absorbing
idea.
</p><p>
'Messere,' he added, more quietly, 'be so kind as to say
plainly, are we going to fly, or are we not?'
</p><p>
Leonardo had not the heart to tell him the naked truth.
</p><p>
'We cannot be quite certain till we have made the experiment,'
he replied; 'but I think we shall fly.'
</p><p>
'That is enough; I ask no more,' said the mechanic,
clapping his hands. 'If <i>you</i> say we shall fly, then the thing
is done.'
</p><p>
He presently burst into a great laugh.
</p><p>
'What the devil amuses you?' asked Leonardo.
</p><p>
'Ah, forgive me, Master! I am always disturbing you.
But when I fall a-thinking of the poor folk of Milan, and of
the French soldiers, and Il Moro, and the king, I have to
laugh because I feel so sorry for them. Poor little creeping
worms, poor little jumping grasshoppers! Always on the
same plot of earth to which they are chained by their feet,
they fight and they bite each other, and they think they are
doing some very great thing! How they will stare and gape
when they see men alive and flying. I misdoubt that they
will believe their eyes. "These be two gods," they will say.
Astro, a god! I doubt the whole world will be changed. I
doubt wars and laws will be done with, and masters and slaves.
We cannot conceive how it will be! Soaring up to heaven
like the choirs of angels, all the people will shout Hosanna!
O Messer Leonardo, Messer Leonardo! is it true that verily
thus it will be?'
</p><p>
He spoke wildly, like one in delirium.
</p><p>
'Poor fool!' thought Leonardo; 'what blind faith! What
is to be done? How can I tell him the truth? He will go
crazed!'
</p><p>
At this moment there was a great knock at the street door,
then a noise of voices and steps, and then a rap at the door
of the studio.
</p><p>
'What devil comes at this hour?' growled Astro. 'A pox
on him! Who is there? You won't see the Master. He has
gone away from Milan.'</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>

'Tis I, Astro&mdash;Luca Pacioli, the mathematician! Open,
open, for God's sake!'
</p><p>
The smith opened and let the friar enter. His face was
blanched with terror. Leonardo asked him hurriedly what
had happened.
</p><p>
'To me, Messer Leonardo, nought&mdash;or leastways of that
I will speak later. I come from the castle. Oh, Messer
Leonardo! The Gascon bowmen&mdash;in fact the French&mdash;I
saw it with my own eyes! <i>They are destroying your Cavallo.</i>
Let us run! Let us run!'
</p><p>
'Soft!' said the painter, though he also had paled. 'What
shall we do by running?'
</p><p>
'But you cannot sit here with folded hands while your
masterpiece is perishing? I have a recommendation to
Monsieur de la Tr&#233;mouille. We must implore him&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
'We are too late.'
</p><p>
'No, no! there is still time! We can run by the garden,
through the hedge. If we but make haste!'
</p><p>
Dragged along by the monk, Leonardo set forth for the
castle. On the way Fra Luca told him of his own misadventure.
The <i>lanzknechts</i> had plundered the cellar of the
<i>Canonica</i> of San Simpliciano, where he dwelt; and being
drunken, had wrought havoc through the house; and in Fra
Luca's cell, having chanced on certain geometrical models
made in crystal, had taken them for instruments of magic,
and smashed them to atoms.
</p><p>
'My poor innocent crystals, which had done them no manner
of wrong,' mourned the friar! Reached the piazza before
the castle, they saw a young French dandy attended by a
numerous suite on the drawbridge.
</p><p>
'Maître Gilles!' cried Fra Luca overjoyed; and he explained
to Leonardo that this was a considerable and authoritative
personage; his title, 'Whistler to the woodhens,' his
office, to teach the finches, magpies, parrots, and thrushes of
the most Christian king their feats of singing, talking,
dancing, and other performances. Rumour asserted that the
'woodhens' were not the only bipeds who danced to the
piping of Maître Gilles; and altogether Fra Luca had long
felt that he must be presented with his books (richly bound)
<i>De Divina Proportione</i> and <i>Summa Aritmetica</i>.
</p><p>
'Fra Luca,' said Leonardo, 'do not lose your opportunity&mdash;attend
Maître Gilles. I can manage my own case.'</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>

'No, no,' said the other, somewhat ashamed, 'I can wait;
or I will just fly to him for an instant and learn whither he
is going, and in a trice I will be back with you&mdash;go you on
towards Monsieur de la Tr&#233;mouille.'
</p><p>
And gathering up the skirts of his brown habit, his bare
feet shod with clattering wooden pattens, the nimble monk
ran after the 'Whistler to the Woodhens'; while Leonardo
crossed the drawbridge and entered the inner court of the
castle.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The morning mists were rising, and the watch-fires already
dying down. The courtyard was crowded with cannon,
ammunition, camp equipage, stable provender and refuse.
All around were movable booths and cooking-spits, empty
barrels serving as card-tables, hogsheads of wine, barrows
of provisions; great noises of laughter, curses, quarrelings in
many tongues, blasphemies, drunken shoutings and songs.
At times an interval of sudden stillness when officers of rank
passed. At times drums beat and brazen trumpets gave signal
to the Rhenish and Suabian <i>lanzknechts</i>, or Alpine horns were
blown from the walls by mercenaries from the Free Cantons
of Uri and Unterwalden.
</p><p>
Making his way through the crowd of men and things,
Leonardo reached the centre of the square and found that
the Colossus, the happy labour for years of his maturest art,
was still intact. The great duke, conqueror of Lombardy,
Francesco Attendolo Sforza, with his bald head, in form like
that of some Roman emperor, and his expression of leonine
cruelty and vulpine cunning, erect as ever, still sat his huge
plunging charger and trampled on his foe.
</p><p>
A great crowd of archers of various nationalities surrounded
the statue, disputing each in his own language, and gesticulating.
Leonardo gathered that a contest was imminent between
a French and a German marksman, who, after drinking
four tankards of wine were to shoot at a distance of fifty
paces at the birthmark on the cheek of the great Sforza.
The paces were measured; lots were drawn as to who
should shoot first; the wine was poured out. The German
drank the fill of a tankard without drawing breath, another,
and another, and another. Then he took his aim, bent the
bow, launched his arrow, and missed the mark. The arrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
grazed the cheek, and took off the tip of the left ear, but did
no further damage. It was now the turn of the Frenchman.
He had brought his arbalist to his shoulder, when a commotion
arose among the onlookers. The crowd divided, making
space for the procession of a knight and his escort of resplendent
followers. He rode past, not heeding the marksmen.
</p><p>
'Who is that?' inquired Leonardo.
</p><p>
'Monseigneur de la Tr&#233;mouille.'
</p><p>
'Then I am in time,' thought the artist; 'I must pursue
him and make supplication.'
</p><p>
Nevertheless he actually stood motionless where he was;
oppressed by an inability, a paralysis of the will, that would
have hindered the stirring of a finger had his very life
been in danger. Repugnance, shame, seized him at the
thought of pushing his way through the crowd that he might,
like Fra Luca Pacioli, run after and pull at the skirts of a
person of quality. The Gascon shot his arrow; it whizzed
through the air, hit the mark, and penetrated deeply into the
mole on Francesco's cheek.
</p><p>
'<i>Bigorre! Bigorre! Montjoie! Saint Denis!</i>' shouted the
soldiers, throwing their caps into the air, '<i>Vive la France</i>!'
The noisy crowd again encircled the Colossus, the jargon of
many tongues broke forth anew; a fresh match was arranged,
and again arrows whistled on the air and wounded the great
Duke. Leonardo could not move. Inconceivable as it may
seem, rooted to the spot as in some hideous dream, he watched
the slow destruction of the work of the six best years of his
life; of perhaps the greatest monument of the sculptor's art
since the days of Phidias and Praxiteles. Under a hail of
bullets, arrows, and even stones, the brittle clay was broken
off in lumps or resolved into dust; the supports were laid bare.
The Colossus had become an immense iron skeleton.
</p><p>
The sun streamed out from behind a bank of clouds.
Nothing remained but the headless body of a man, the
trunk of a horse, the fragment of a sceptre, and the inscription
on the pedestal. 'Behold a god!' Just then the
commandant of the French troops, the old Marshal Gian
Giacomo Trivulzio, rode up. He looked at the place of the
Colossus, stopped in sheer astonishment, looked again, shading
his eyes from the sun; then turned to his attendants and
asked&mdash;
</p><p>
'In the name of God, what has taken place?'</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>

'<i>Monseigneur</i>,' replied a lieutenant. 'Captain Cockburn
gave permission to his cross-bowmen&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
'The Sforza monument! the work of Leonardo da Vinci&mdash;I
made a target for the archers of Gascony!' cried the marshal,
and he rushed at the men, who, intent on their work of destruction,
had not observed his displeasure; seized a Frenchman by
the collar and flung him to the ground, rating him soundly.
In his fury the old general had become quite purple.
</p><p>
'<i>Monseigneur</i>,' stammered the soldier, struggling to his
knees, shaking with fright, '<i>Monseigneur</i>, we did not know!
Captain Cockburn had said&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
'To hell with your Captain Cockburn! I'll hang every
man jack of you!'
</p><p>
He flourished his sword and would have wounded some one
had not Leonardo caught his wrist with such force that the
brazen sword-hilt was bent.
</p><p>
Trivulzio stared at the stranger in dire amazement while
struggling to free himself.
</p><p>
'Who is this man?' he exclaimed indignantly, and the
artist himself replied:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Leonardo da Vinci.'
</p><p>
'And how do you dare&mdash;&mdash;' began the old marshal, still
beside himself, but meeting the clear unfaltering gaze of the
eyes fixed upon him, he broke off. 'Eh? you are Leonardo?'
he said. 'I pray you loose my arm&mdash;you have crushed the
hilt.'
</p><p>
'<i>Monseigneur</i>,' said Leonardo, 'I beseech you.&mdash;Pardon
these poor fools!'
</p><p>
The marshal again stared in amazement; then smiled, and
shook his head.
</p><p>
'A strange fellow! What? You entreat for them?'
</p><p>
'If your Excellence hangs every mother's son among them,
what will it profit me? They knew not what they did.'
</p><p>
The old man became thoughtful, then his face cleared, and
his small intelligent eyes shone with good nature.
</p><p>
'Hark ye, Messer Leonardo! There is one thing passes
me. How could you stand there stock-still, looking on?
Why did you not complain to me? or to Monseigneur de la
Tr&#233;mouille? He must have passed by within an hour!'
</p><p>
Leonardo looked down and reddened. 'I was not in
time,' he stammered, 'I&mdash;&mdash;I don't know Monsieur de la
Tr&#233;mouille.'</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>

''Tis a misfortune,' said the old man; and surveying the
ruin, he exclaimed with great vehemence, 'I would have given
a hundred of my best troopers for your Colossus!'
</p><p>
On his way home, Leonardo crossed the bridge just under
Bramante's loggia, the scene of his last interview with the
Duke. Pages and grooms were chasing the swans which were
so dear to Il Moro; and the poor creatures unable to escape
from the moat, fluttered and screamed in agonies. The water
was flecked with down and snowy feathers; here and there
on its blackness floated a white blood-stained body. One
newly-wounded bird stretched its graceful neck in the convulsions
of death, uttering piercing cries and flapping its
weakening wings, as if in a last vain effort for flight. Leonardo
averted his eyes and hurried away.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span> made his entry into the Lombard capital punctually
on the 6th of October. Great crowds assembled to see
the procession; and the newly-mended angels of the Milanese
Commune waved their gilded wings to the admiration of all.
</p><p>
Leonardo had not touched his flying-machine since the
day of the destruction of the <i>Cavallo</i>; but Astro still laboured
at it indefatigably, now and then looking reproachfully at the
Master with his one eye, in which blazed fires of zeal and
hope.
</p><p>
One morning Pacioli came running with a message from
the king, summoning Messer Leonardo to the castle. The
artist was unwilling to leave Astro, for he had not confessed
that the new apparatus was a failure, and he feared
lest the enthusiast should endanger his neck in some rash
experiment. However, he set forth, and presently arrived at
the <i>Sala della Rocchetta</i> where Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span> was receiving the
magistrates and chief citizens of the city.
</p><p>
Leonardo looked at his new sovereign with attention, but
discovered nothing regal in his aspect. He was lean and
feeble, with narrow shoulders, a hollow chest, and a face
curiously wrinkled. Evidently used to suffering, it had conferred
on him neither nobility nor grace; his virtues were at
best of the <i>bourgeois</i> type.
</p><p>
A young man, twenty years of age, dressed simply in black,
stood on the first step of the throne. He wore no ornaments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
except a few pearls in the looping of his hat, and the gold
chain of the Order of St. Michael: his face was pale, his flaxen
hair was worn long, and he had dark blue eyes, soft, but
singularly penetrating and observant.
</p><p>
'Tell me, Fra Luca,' whispered Leonardo, 'who is that
young noble?'
</p><p>
'Cæsar Borgia, the son of the pope, the Duke of Valentinois,'
replied the monk.
</p><p>
Leonardo was not ignorant of the crimes imputed to this
young man. There was little doubt that he had murdered
his brother in order that, exchanging the cardinal's purple for
the title of <i>Gran Gonfaloniere</i> of the Roman Church, he
might himself have the chief place in the family honours.
Further, the whisper ran, that the motive of the fratricide was
not ambition only, but a monstrous rivalry between the
brothers for the favour of their sister Lucrezia.
</p><p>
'That, at least, is impossible,' thought Leonardo, looking at
the calm face and clear soft eyes.
</p><p>
Cæsar probably felt Leonardo's scrutinising gaze, for he
turned and asked his secretary some question, pointing at the
artist as he spoke. The secretary, a man of venerable aspect,
replied in a whisper, and Cæsar in his turn looked intently at
Leonardo, while a subtle smile played upon his lips.
</p><p>
'Nay, it is not impossible,' thought the artist, answering his
own hasty judgment; 'anything is possible to that face;
perhaps even worse than we have heard.'
</p><p>
The spokesman of the town syndics, having finished the
reading of a long and tedious document, approached the
throne and presented the parchment to the king. Louis
accidentally dropped it, and before the citizen could pick
it up, Cæsar had stooped dexterously and quickly, had lifted
the roll, and placed it in the king's hand.
</p><p>
'He never loses an opportunity,' grumbled some one standing
near Leonardo.
</p><p>
'You are right,' responded another; 'the pope's son understands
the arts of service. You should see him of a morning
at the king's dressing! He warms his shirt for him! I
daresay he'd be ready even to wash out the stable.'
</p><p>
Leonardo also had observed Cæsar's too obsequious action,
which seemed to him terrible rather than servile, like the
caress of a wild beast; but he was no longer permitted to
play the part of a spectator, for Pacioli dragged him forward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
and presented him to the king with a short speech made
up of superlatives&mdash;'<i>stupendissimo! prestantissimo! invincibilissimo!</i>'
and the like. Louis spoke at once of the <i>Cenacolo</i>,
praising the figures of the Apostles, and waxing enthusiastic
over the perspective of the roof. Fra Luca was quite sure
his Majesty had a post ready to offer to the great artist; but
unluckily at this moment a page brought in letters from
France, and the king's attention was engrossed by the news
that his loved wife, Anne of Brittany, had been delivered of a
princess. The courtiers crowded round with their congratulations,
and Leonardo and Pacioli were pushed into the background.
Pacioli would again have dragged his friend forward,
but Leonardo objected, and presently left the palace.
</p><p>
On the drawbridge he was overtaken by Messer Agapito,
Borgia's secretary, who by command of his master offered him
the post of '<i>Ingegner ducale</i>' (chief engineer), which he had
already filled under Il Moro.
</p><p>
Leonardo said he would reply after a few days' reflection,
and went on towards his house.
</p><p>
Presently he saw a crowd of people, and hurried his steps
with a presentiment of disaster. The fear was well grounded;
his pupils Giovanni, Marco, Salaino, and Cesare, unable to
procure a litter, were carrying the unfortunate Astro on
the broken wing of the new and ill-fated flying-machine, his
garments blood-stained and torn, his face white as death.
Leonardo guessed at once what had occurred. The smith,
great in resolution and in faith, had adventured on the
machine. He had fitted the apparatus to his shoulders, and
leaped into the air. Then he had fallen, and would probably
have been killed had not one of the wings caught in the boughs
of a tree. Leonardo helped to carry the poor wretch home;
with his own hands he laid him on a bed and bent over him
to examine his hurts. Astro recovered from his swoon, and
looking up with supplicating eyes, murmured&mdash;
</p><p>
'O Master! Forgive!'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span> celebrated the birth of his daughter with great
feasts, and a solemn thanksgiving mass was performed in the
cathedral. The city was quiet, and all seemed peaceful and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
prosperous. Having exacted an oath of fealty from his new
subjects, he appointed Marshal Trivulzio his viceroy, and
returned to France early in November.
</p><p>
The calm was, however, deceitful; Trivulzio soon made himself
detested by his cruelty and greed; the adherents of the
banished Ludovico took heart, and inflamed the people by
liberal distribution of seditious letters. Soon those who had
sent Il Moro forth with objurgations and jeers, proclaimed
him the best and wisest of sovereigns.
</p><p>
Towards the end of January a crowd wrecked the offices of
the tax-collector beside the Porta Ticinese; next day there
was rioting near Pavia. The cause of the latter disturbance
was an attempt made by a French soldier on the chastity of a
peasant girl, who struck her assailant with a broom handle and
was then threatened by him with an axe. She screamed; her
father ran up with a cudgel and was killed by the soldier.
Then the crowd fell upon the soldier and he was killed; after
which the French drew on the populace and sacked the
village.
</p><p>
When the news of this outrage reached Milan it acted like
a spark upon gunpowder. The people poured into the
squares, the streets, the market-places, shouting 'Down with
the king! Down with Trivulzio! Death to the foreigners!
<i>Viva Il Moro!</i>'
</p><p>
The French troops were too few to withstand attack from
the three hundred thousand inhabitants of Milan. Trivulzio
placed guns upon the tower which for the present was in use
as the cathedral belfry, but before giving the order to fire
on the crowd he tried one more effort at pacification.
He was hustled, hunted into the Palazzo del Comune, and
would have perished there but for the timely intervention
of the Swiss mercenaries. Then ensued burning and pillaging;
torture and murder of all foreigners and their sympathisers
who fell into the hands of the citizens. On the 1st of
February Trivulzio fled, leaving the fortress in charge of the
Captains d'Espe and Codecara. That very night Il Moro
returned from Germany, and was received with great joy
by the town of Como; all Milan anxiously awaited him as
its saviour.
</p><p>
In these last days of the revolt, when the streets were being
wrecked on all sides by the cannonade, Leonardo transferred
his household to the ample cellars of his house, contriving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
living-rooms of tolerable comfort, and storing everything of
value: pictures, drawings, manuscripts, scientific instruments.
</p><p>
He had definitely resolved to enter Cæsar Borgia's service,
and was to present himself in Romagna not later than the
summer of 1500; meanwhile he proposed to visit his friend,
Girolamo Melzi, at his villa of Vaprio in the vicinity of Milan,
living there in retirement till the disturbances were at an end.
On the morning of February the 2nd, the Feast of the Purification,
Fra Luca brought him the tidings that the castle had
been flooded. A Milanese, Luigi da Porto, who had been in
Trivulzio's service, had deserted to the rebels, first opening all
the sluices which fed the moats of the fortress. The water
spread over the circumjacent lands, reaching to the walls
of the Rocchetta; and, making its way into the magazine
and provision stores, almost forced the French to surrender,
which was precisely what Messer Luigi had hoped. The
flood had also overflowed the canal, had inundated the
low lying suburb of Porta Vercellina, where was situated
the Monastery delle Grazie. Fra Luca expressed grave fears
for Leonardo's <i>Cenacolo</i> and offered to go with him and see how
it fared.
</p><p>
The painter, feigning indifference, replied that he was too
busy, and that he believed the height of the fresco would
preserve it from injury. No sooner, however, was he rid of
Pacioli than he hastened to the convent refectory, on the brick
floor of which pools were still left, and where there was a
pervading odour of miasma and stagnant water. A monk told
him that the flood had risen to the fourth of a cubit.
</p><p>
The <i>Cenacolo</i> had not been painted in water-colours, according
to the usage for fresco; such process requiring a rapidity
of execution alien to Leonardo's genius.
</p><p>
'A painter who has no doubts will have small success,' he
used to say; and for his doubts, his vacillations, his experiments,
corrections, and extreme slowness, only the medium of
oil was suitable. It was in vain that experienced masters
told him that oil paints were impossible for a damp wall
standing on the verge of a marsh. His love of experiment,
and of new paths and devices induced him to disregard all
warnings; he mixed his paints in a special way, and prepared
the wall by coating it first with clay, varnished and oiled,
then with a mixture of mastic, pitch and plaster.
</p><p>
Having dismissed the monk, Leonardo crossed the still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
soaking refectory floor, and stepped close to examine his
picture. The transparent and delicate colours seemed uninjured,
and not even blurred; however he took a magnifying-glass
and explored the surface in every part. To his dismay,
there in the left-hand corner, just where the tablecloth was
represented hanging in ample folds by the feet of St Bartholomew,
he discovered a small crack; beside it the colours were
already fading, and on the surface was a white velvety patch,
scarce observable, but the beginning of mould. Sudden paleness
overspread Leonardo's features; he composed himself,
however, and continued his examination with minuter care.
Very soon he realised what had happened. The first coating of
varnished clay had bulged in consequence of the damp and
had come away from the wall, raising the upper coating
of plaster which carried the paint; and in the plaster tiny
almost invisible cracks had formed, through which a salt
sweat exuded from the porous brickwork. The <i>Cenacolo</i> was
doomed. The colours might last forty or fifty years and
Leonardo himself never see their decay, but it was impossible
to doubt that this his greatest work must irretrievably perish.
He stood looking at the face of his Christ; realising for the
first time how dear to him was this, his supreme creation.
</p><p>
The ruin of the <i>Cenacolo</i>, the destruction of the <i>Cavallo</i>,
snapped the last threads which bound him to men, which
united him to friends perhaps still unborn. His soul had long
been solitary; now his solitude was deeper than before. The
clay of the Colossus, resolved into dust, was the sport of the
winds of heaven; mould was gathering on the very countenance
of the Lord, dimming its outline, blurring and fading
its colours. All that had been his very life was vanishing as a
shadow.
</p><p>
He came away, leaving the monastery without speaking to
any one; made his way to his deserted house, and descended
to the place of refuge underground. He passed through the
room where lay the unfortunate Astro, and stopped for a
moment to speak to Giovanni who was preparing a compress
for the sick man's brow.
</p><p>
'Fever again?' asked the Master.
</p><p>
'Yes; he is delirious.'
</p><p>
Leonardo watched the bandaging, and listened for a few
minutes to the rapid disconnected babble which came from
the lips of the poor broken enthusiast.</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>

'Higher! Higher! Straight to the sun&mdash;so long as the
wings don't catch fire! Ha! little one! who are you? What
is your name? Mechanics? That is a scurvy name! I never
heard of a devil named Mechanics! What are you jeering at?
Is it a joke? That's enough now; you have had your joke,
and I've done with you. Ah!&mdash;Lift me! Lift me! I can
bear no more! Let me just get my breath. Oh&mdash;death and
damnation!' His face was anguished; cries of terror burst
from his lips; he fancied himself falling into the abyss. But
this passed and the rapid babbling recommenced.
</p><p>
'No, no! mock not! The fault was mine own. He told
me they were not ready. Ay, he said so. I have betrayed
the Master! I have betrayed the Master! Hush! Hush!
O yes, I know him! the smallest and the heaviest of all the
devils&mdash;the little one named Mechanics.'
</p><p>
Leonardo, leaning over the bed, could not avert his gaze.
He was thinking&mdash;
</p><p>
'Here is another man whom I have destroyed.'
</p><p>
He laid his hand on Astro's burning forehead. It appeared
to calm him, little by little he became quieter, and presently
he sank into heavy sleep. Leonardo retired to his underground
cell, and buried himself in his calculations. He was
now studying the laws of the wind, and the aerial currents, and
comparing them with the laws of the waves and currents of the
sea&mdash;all still with reference to this question of flight.
</p><p>
'If you throw two stones of equal size into a pool, at a little
distance from each other,'&mdash;he said slowly to himself&mdash;'two
widening circles will be formed on the surface of the
water. Then will come a moment in which the first circle
will meet the second; will it enter and bisect it? or will
the waves be refracted at their point of contact? I answer,
taking my stand on experience: the two circles will intersect
each other, remaining, however, distinct and keeping their
respective centres at the points where the stones fell.'
</p><p>
The simplicity with which nature had solved this mechanical
problem filled him with enthusiasm: 'How subtle is this!
How beautiful!'
</p><p>
He made a calculation, and the result added to his conviction
that the mathematical sciences, with their laws founded
on the essential necessities of reason, justified the natural
necessities of mechanics.
</p><p>
Hour after hour flew by unnoticed, and evening came on.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
After supper, and relaxation in talk with his pupils, he again
set to work. The acumen and lucidity of his thoughts
convinced him that he was on the verge of some great
discovery.
</p><p>
'Behold how the wind, blowing across the fields, drives
waves over the rye, one succeeding the other, while the stalks,
though they bend, remain fixed in the ground! In like
manner do the waves run over the immovable water. The
ripple caused by the throwing of a stone, or by the force of
the wind, should rather be called a shiver than a movement
of the water. And of this you may persuade yourself by
throwing a straw into the widening rings of wavelets, and
watching how it rises and falls, but does not leave its
place.'
</p><p>
This experiment with the straw reminded him of a similar
test which he had applied when studying the waves of sound.
He mused&mdash;
</p><p>
'The striking of a bell will induce a slight quiver and a
low resonance in a neighbouring bell; a note sounded on a lute
will awake the same note in a lute by its side; and a straw
laid upon the string which produces that note will show its
vibration.'
</p><p>
The soul of the student was greatly stirred; he divined
some connection, a whole world of undiscovered knowledge,
between the two oscillating straws; the one trembling on the
surface of the waves, the other quivering on the vibrating
string. And an idea, swift as lightning, flashed across his
mind.
</p><p>
'The mechanical law is the same in the two cases! Like
the waves on the water when a stone drops into it, so the
waves of sound widen in the air, intersecting others, but not
mingling with them, keeping their own centre in the place of
their origin. What, then, of light? As an echo is the reproduction
of a sound, the reflection in a mirror is an echo of
light. There is but one mechanical law in all the phenomena
of physical force; there is but one will; and this will is thy
justice, O Prime Mover! the angle of incidence must be
equal to the angle of reflection.'
</p><p>
His face pale, his eyes burning with enthusiasm, Leonardo
felt that once again, and this time more certainly than
before, he was about to sound an abyss into which no man
had looked before. He knew that this discovery, if confirmed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
by experiment, was the greatest mechanical discovery
since the days of Archimedes. Two months ago, when he
had heard that Vasco di Gama had doubled the Cape of Good
Hope and discovered a new route to India, Leonardo had
envied him, but now he had made a greater discovery than
di Gama or Columbus; he had sighted more mysterious expanses,
and no less than they had found a new heaven and
a new earth.
</p><p>
But through the wall there reached his ears the groans and
the ravings of the sufferer. He listened, and remembered
his mechanics, the senseless destruction of the Colossus, the
inevitable ruin of the <i>Cenacolo</i>, Astro's foolish and horrible
fall; and asked himself:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Will this discovery be lost as completely, as ignominiously
as all else which I have done? Will no man heed my voice?
shall I ever be solitary as now? here alone in the darkness,
underground, as if buried alive? I who have dreamed of
wings!' After a short pause, he added: 'Be it so! Darkness,
and silence, and oblivion, and none to know what I
have done! <i>I</i> know it!'
</p><p>
And indomitable pride, a sense of inalienable victory and
strength filled his soul, as if the wings to which he had
aspired were already lifting him above the earth.
</p><p>
The subterranean chamber suddenly became too strait for
him; he felt stifled, and the longing was irresistible to behold
the sky, and the open country. He left the house, and
walked swiftly towards the cathedral.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The night was moonlit, serene, and warm; from the conflagration
sullen flames still glowed, and smoky spirals still
rose into the sky.
</p><p>
The crowd increased as he drew nearer to the centre of
the town. The blue rays of the moon, the scarlet glare of
the torches, illuminated faces haggard with excitement,
seamed with anxiety, and played on the white banner
with the scarlet cross which had been used by the ancient
Milanese Commune, on lantern-poles, arquebuses, pistols,
clubs, halberts, scythes, pitchforks, stakes, all pressed into
service against the foreigner. The people swarmed like ants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
the tocsin pealed, the guns roared. From the fortress the
French were firing down the street, and their boast was that
they would not leave one stone upon another within the
city walls. Louder than the bells, more piercing than the
booming of the cannon, rose the incessant yell of the
citizens: 'Death to the French! Death to the foreigners!
Down with the king! <i>Viva Il Moro!</i>'
</p><p>
To Leonardo it gave the impression of a wild and hideous
dream. Near the eastern gate, a drummer from Picardy,
a boy of sixteen, was being hanged, Mascarello the goldsmith
playing the part of executioner. Flinging the rope round the
lad's neck, and tapping him lightly on the head, he cried with
ribald solemnity:&mdash;
</p><p>
'In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,
we dub this servant of God, this Frenchman, Saltamacchia,
Knight of the Hempen Necklace.'
</p><p>
'Amen!' responded the crowd.
</p><p>
The little drummer, ill understanding his danger, half
smiling, blinking his eyes like a child about to cry, shrank
into himself, twisting his neck that he might ease the noose.
Then suddenly, as if awaking from a lethargy, he turned his
beautiful but white and trembling face to the crowd, and
would have attempted entreaty. His voice was drowned by
howls and derisive laughter, and he gave up the attempt,
holding his peace with the forlorn air of a resigned and
innocent victim, and kissing a little cross, the gift of his
mother or sister, which he had worn on a blue ribbon round
his neck. Then Mascarello swung him into the void, with
the jeer: 'Courage, Knight of the Necklace! Show us how
you dance the French <i>gaillard</i>!'
</p><p>
And, mid the laughter of the crowd, the child's body
shuddered horribly, and was convulsed in the spasms of
death, as if indeed it were dancing.
</p><p>
Leonardo walked on, and presently he saw a woman,
dressed in rags, kneeling before a miserable half-ruined hovel,
and stretching out thin bare arms to the passers-by.
</p><p>
'Help; Help! Help!' she cried incessantly.
</p><p>
Corbolo the shoemaker, running up, asked what ailed her.
</p><p>
'My baby! My baby! He was sleeping, so pretty in his
little bed! He has fallen through the floor! Perhaps he is
still alive! Oh, save him! Try and save him! <i>Help!</i>'
</p><p>
Just then a cannon-ball, rending the air with a shriek,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
struck the roof of the hovel. The beams cracked, dust rose
in a column, the roof fell, the walls crumbled, and the woman
was for ever silenced.
</p><p>
Again Leonardo moved on, and presently he reached the
Palazzo del Comune. Here, in front of the Loggia degli
Osii, an university student was haranguing the crowd,
descanting on the ancient glory of the Milanese, and
exhorting the people to annihilate all tyrants, and establish
the reign of equality. His hearers, however, seemed hard of
persuasion.
</p><p>
'Citizens!' he cried, brandishing the knife which on
ordinary occasions served him for mending pens, slicing
sausages, and cutting his sweetheart's name on the bark of
trees, but which now he had christened 'the Poniard of
Nemesis,' 'Citizens! the hour has come in which we must
die for Liberty! We will wash our hands in the blood of
the tyrants; in their breasts we will plunge this Poniard of
Nemesis. <i>Viva la Repubblica!</i>'
</p><p>
'Folly!' cried voices from the audience. 'We know the
wine of your vintage! We know the liberty you would give
us, you spy, traitor, dog of a Frenchman! To the devil with
you and your republic! <i>Viva Il Moro!</i> Death to all
enemies of the duke!'
</p><p>
The orator continued to prate, enforcing his doctrine by
instances from Cicero and Tacitus, but the mob overthrew
his bench, knocked him down and beat him, shouting:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Here's for your Liberty! Here's for your Republic!
Here's for inflaming fools against their legitimate ruler!'
</p><p>
Leonardo stood for a minute in the Piazza dell' Arengo to
admire the imposing pile of the cathedral&mdash;that marble
forest of pinnacles and towers, fantastic in the double light,
blue rays of the moon and crimson flare of torches. In front
of the archbishop's palace the press was so great that there
was scarce standing-room, and from the centre of the throng
came groans and ferocious howls.
</p><p>
'What has happened?' asked the painter of an old workman,
whose gentle dignified face was blanched with horror.
</p><p>
'Who can understand? They themselves know neither
what they want nor what they do. They are accusing Messer
Jacopo Crotta of selling poisoned flour, and of being a
French spy! <i>O Dio! Dio!</i> It is a lie! But they fall on
the first man they meet, and listen to none! 'Tis horrible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
'tis most horrible! Lord Jesus, have mercy on us, wretched
sinners!'
</p><p>
Just then Gorgoglio the glass-blower detached himself
from the dense pack of human bodies, holding aloft a
bloody human head stuck on a pole; and Farfannicchio,
the madcap of the streets, danced round it, screaming and
yelling.
</p><p>
'Down with the traitors! down with the foreigners!
Death to the devils of Frenchmen!'
</p><p>
'<i>A furore populi, libera nos, Domine!</i>' murmured the old
workman, crossing himself.
</p><p>
From the castle came an incessant sound of trumpets,
drums, explosions of cannon, crackling of guns, cries of
soldiers. The monster bombard, called by the French
<i>Margot la Folle</i>, and by the Germans <i>die tolle Grete</i>, was
fired; the earth shook, it seemed that the whole town must
crash into ruins. The bomb fell beyond the Borgonuovo, and
set fire to a house; pillars of flame rose into the quiet
moonlit sky, and the piazza was lit with a crimson glare.
The people hurried hither and thither, jostling, pushing,
trampling each other like black shadows, like living
phantoms.
</p><p>
Leonardo stood watching the wild scene, noting every
detail, his mind preoccupied. The fiery glow, the voices
of the crowd, the pealing of the bells, the boom of the
guns, all brought back his discovery. Imagination pictured
the waves of sound, the waves of light swelling tranquilly,
circling outwards like the ripple on water where a stone has
fallen, intersecting each other without mingling or confusion,
each keeping its own centre in the point of its origin.
Great gladness filled his soul as he thought that never at
any time could men interrupt the harmonious play of these
ordered waves, nor the mechanical law which rules them,
the unchanging fiat of their creator, the rule of divine justice,
making the angle of incidence equal to the angle of
reflection.
</p><p>
In his soul re-echoed&mdash;
</p><p>
'O wondrous justice of thee, thou Prime Mover! No force
hast thou permitted to lack the order and the quality of its
necessary effect!'
</p><p>
In the frenzied crowd, the soul of the artist preserved the
eternal calm of contemplation; even as the blue rays of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
moon shone with heavenly effulgence supreme over glare of
torches and flames of conflagration and war.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On a certain morning in February 1500, Ludovico Sforza,
Il Moro, re-entered Milan by the Porta Nuova. Leonardo
had started the previous night for Vaprio, his friend Melzi's
villa.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Girolamo Melzi had once belonged to the court of the Sforzas,
but on the death of his young wife in 1494 he had retired
to his lonely villa at the foot of the Alps, a few hours' journey
from Milan. Far from the noise of the world, he lived the life
of a philosopher, gardening with his own hands, and devoting
himself to music and to the study of the occult sciences. Some
said he was an adept in black magic, accustomed to call up the
shade of his lost wife from the lower world. The mathematician,
Fra Luca Pacioli, and Sacrobosco, the alchemist, often
visited him, and whole nights were spent in argument about
Plato's ideas, and the laws of the Pythagorean numbers which
governed the music of the spheres. But Melzi found his chief
pleasure in the visits of Leonardo, which were not infrequent,
as the works on the Martesana Canal often brought him to the
vicinity.
</p><p>
Vaprio was situated on the left bank of the Adda; and the
canal, skirting the villa garden, ran for a certain distance
parallel to the river, the course of which was just here
obstructed by rapids. All day the roar of the cataract made
itself heard, loud as the billows of the sea surf. Free, wild,
storm-tossed, untamed by man, the Adda hurled its green
waves between winding precipitous banks of yellow sandstone.
By its side, the same cold, green, mountain water swam
noiselessly by within the straight-drawn confines of the
canal; smooth as a mirror, calm, slow, submissive and subdued.
The contrast delighted Leonardo, and seemed to him
of pregnant meaning. Which of the two streams was the
more beautiful&mdash;the Martesana, his own creation, the work of
human intelligence and will, or its elder sister, the foaming
Adda, savage, threatening, superb in its untrammelled freedom?
He understood each, sympathised with each, and loved them
with equal love.
</p><p>
From the upper terrace of the villa garden was a wide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
prospect of the immense Lombard plain, one vast and smiling
garden. In the summer the fields were rank with verdure;
hay scented the air; the wheat and the maize grew so tall as to
overtop the vines; ears of corn kissed the pears and the
apples, the cherries and the plums. The hills of Como rose
dark towards the north; above them towered the first spurs of
the Alps; higher still the snow-clad summits glowed in the
sunset gold.
</p><p>
Fra Luca and Messer Galeotto Sacrobosco, whose cottage
by the Porta Vercellina had been destroyed by the French,
were both at the villa when Leonardo arrived; but he kept
himself apart, preferring solitude. He conceived, however,
a great fondness for the company of Francesco, his host's
little son.
</p><p>
Timid and shy as a girl, the boy at first stood in great awe
of the painter; one day, however, he came into his room at a
moment when Leonardo, studying the laws of colour, was
experimenting with coloured glass. He pleased the child
by letting him look through the different pieces, yellow, blue,
purple, or green, which gave a fairy aspect to familiar objects,
and made the world seem now smiling, now frowning, according
to the colour of the glass. Another of Leonardo's
inventions proved very attractive. This was the 'Camera
obscura,' by means of which living pictures appeared on a
sheet of white paper; and Francesco saw the turning of
the mill-wheel, the swallows circling round the church, the
woodcutter's grey donkey with his load of faggots stepping
daintily along the miry road while the poplars bowed their
heads under the breeze. Still more fascinating was the
weather-gauge: a copper ring, a small stick like the beam of a
balance, and two little balls, the one covered with wax,
the other with wadding. When the air was saturated with
moisture the wadding grew heavy, and the little ball, falling
down, inclined the beam till it touched one or other of the
divisions marked on the copper ring. The degree of damp
could thus be accurately measured, and the weather predicted
for two or three days. The little boy constructed a similar
apparatus for himself and was jubilant when the prophecies
were fulfilled which he had deduced from its variations.
Francesco went to the village school where he was taught by
the old prior of the neighbour convent. The dog-eared
Latin grammar and arithmetic primer were odious to him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
and he learned but slackly. Leonardo's lore was of a new
sort, pleasant to the child as a fairy tale. The instruments for
the study of optics, acoustics, hydraulics, were to him new
and magical toys, nor was he ever tired of hearing the painter's
talk. Fearing ridicule or suspicion, Leonardo spoke but
cautiously with adults; to Francesco he talked with the utmost
frankness and simplicity. He not only taught the child, but
learned of him. Paraphrasing the text of Holy Writ, he told
himself&mdash;'Except ye be converted and become as little children,
ye shall not enter into the kingdom of knowledge.'
</p><p>
It was at this time that he was writing his <i>Book of the Stars</i>.
On March evenings, when in the still chilly air there was a
waft of spring, he would stand on the roof with Francesco,
watching the tide of stars and sketching the spots on the
face of the moon. Then rolling a piece of paper into an
inverted cone, he bade the child look through the aperture at
the end, and Francesco saw the stars robbed of their rays, and
like bright, round, infinitely minute globules.
</p><p>
'Those globules,' said Leonardo, 'are of great size, many of
them a hundred, nay, a thousand times larger than our earth,
which, however, is not less beautiful nor more contemptible
than they. The mechanical laws which obtain in our world,
and which have been discovered by human sagacity, guide
also those stars and suns.'
</p><p>
'What is there beyond the stars?' murmured the child.
</p><p>
'More stars, Francesco; worlds which we cannot see.'
</p><p>
'And beyond those?'
</p><p>
'Yet others.'
</p><p>
'But at the end, at the very end?'
</p><p>
'There is no end.'
</p><p>
'No end,' cried the boy, and Leonardo felt the trembling of
the little hand within his own. The child's face had grown
pale.
</p><p>
'Then where&mdash;where,' he said slowly, 'where is Paradise,
Messer Leonardo, and the angels, and the saints, and the
Madonna, and God the Father who sits upon the throne with
God the Son and the Holy Spirit?'
</p><p>
The teacher would have liked to answer that God was
everywhere; in the grain of sand no less than in the celestial
globe; in the hearts of men no less than in the outside
universe. But fearing to disturb the simple faith of the little
one he held his peace.</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>

With the first budding of the trees, the painter and the child
spent whole days together in the garden or in the neighbouring
woods watching the reviving of life in the vegetable world.
Sometimes Leonardo would draw a flower or tree, trying to
seize the living likeness as in the portrait of a man; that
unique particular aspect of his model which would never be
repeated. He taught Francesco how the rings seen in the
wood of the trunk reveal the age of the tree; and how the
thickness of each ring shows the amount of moisture in
the year when it was formed; how the core of the trunk is
always on the southern side, which has had the most of the
sun's heat. He told how in the spring-time the sap,
gathering between the inner green of the trunk and the
outer bark, thickens and expands and bursts the bark; how,
if a branch is cut, the vital power draws an abundance of
nutritive juices to the wounded place, so that the bark thickens
and the wound is healed; yet its mark remains because the
abundance of the nutritive juices has been too great, and has
overflowed and made lumps and knots. Always he spoke of
nature dryly and with apparent frigidity, seeking only
scientific accuracy. With passionless exactitude he defined
the tender details of the action of the spring upon the life
of plants, as he would have spoken of the performance of
a machine. He showed from abstract mathematics the
wonderful laws which shape the needles of pine-trees and
the facets of crystals. Yet for all his coldness and impartiality,
the child discerned his love for all living things,
for the withered leaf no less than for the mighty boughs which
spread suppliant arms to their great lord, the sun. At times,
in the depth of the forest, he would pause and note smilingly
how under last year's withered leaves still hanging on the
branches, green shoots were sprouting to oust them from
their place; how the bee, weak from her winter torpor,
could scarce crawl into the snowdrop's cup. In the great
stillness Francesco could hear the beating of his friend's
iron heart; timidly he would raise his eyes to the Master.
The sun shining athwart the branches lit up his long curling
hair, flowing beard, and overhanging brows, and surrounded his
head with a halo: he seemed like Pan himself who listens to
the growing of the grass, the murmuring of spring below the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
earth, the mystical forces of awakening life. To Leonardo all
things lived. The world was one great body, like the body of
man, who himself is a little world. In the dewdrops he saw
the similitude of the watery sphere which surrounds the earth.
The cataracts of the Adda near Trezzo gave him occasion to
study the cascades and whirlpools of rivers which he compared
to the twisting of a woman's curls. Mysterious resemblances
attracted him, concords in nature's harmony like voices
answering each other from distant worlds. Inquiring into
the origin of the rainbow, he noted that the same prismatic
colour is seen in the plumage of birds, precious stones, in
the scum on stagnant water, in old dulled glass. In the
patterns on frosted window-panes, he found a resemblance
to living leaves and flowers, as if nature in this world of
frozen crystal had seen prophetic visions of the coming
spring. At times he felt himself drawing near new realms
of knowledge, perhaps to be entered only by men of ages to
come. He used to say about the attractive powers of
amber:&mdash;
</p><p>
'I see not the mode by which the human mind shall
apprehend the mystery. These powers of the magnet and
the amber are among those occult forces which are as yet
unrevealed.'
</p><p>
And further&mdash;
</p><p>
'The world is full of countless possibilities of which yet
there has been no experience.'
</p><p>
One day, a certain Messer Guidotto Prestinari, a poet from
Bergamo, came to the villa. Offended with Leonardo, who
did not sufficiently praise his verses, he began a discussion on
the comparative excellence of poetry and painting. Leonardo
spoke little, but the fury with which Messer Guidotto assailed
his art at last amused him and he said, half jesting:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Painting is higher than poetry, inasmuch as it reproduces
the eternal works of God and not human inventions, to which
the poets, at least of our day, are too apt to confine themselves.
They depict not, but describe, borrowing all they
have and trading with each other's wares. They but put
together and combine the refuse of knowledge. They may
be compared to the receivers of stolen goods....'
</p><p>
Fra Luca, Messer Galeotto, and Melzi himself cried out;
but Leonardo had now warmed to the subject and cried:&mdash;
</p><p>
'The eye gives a more complete knowledge of nature than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
the ear! Things seen are less to be doubted than things
heard. Painting, which is silent poetry, comes nearer to
positive science than poetry, which is invisible painting.
Words give but a series of isolated images following one
another; but in a picture, all the forms, all the colours
appear synchronously, and are blended into a whole, like the
notes of a chord in music; and thus both to painting and to
music a more complex harmony is possible than to poetry.
And the richer the harmony, the richer is that delight which
is the aim and the enchantment of art. Question, say,
any lover, whether he would not rather have a portrait of his
loved one than a description in words of her countenance,
though it were composed by the greatest of poets?'
</p><p>
This argument provoked a smile, and presently Leonardo
continued:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Hear a narrative from my own experience. A certain
Florentine youth fell into such a longing for the face of a
woman whom I had painted in one of my sacred pictures,
that, having bought it, he cancelled all the signs of its
religious character, so that he might kiss his adored one
without fear or scruple. But soon the voice of conscience
overcame the passion of love, nor could he recover his tranquillity
of mind till he had removed the picture from his
dwelling. Think ye, O poets, that with your words you
could rouse a man to like vehemence of desire? Believe
me, Messeri, I speak not of myself, for I know how greatly I
fall short, but of that painter who attains to the perfection of
his art. He is no longer a man; rapt in the contemplation of
divine and eternal beauty, or turned to the study of monstrous
forms, grotesque, pathetic, terrible, he can comprehend and
give shape to all; he is a sovereign&mdash;a god.'
</p><p>
Many such ideas Leonardo had inscribed in his note-books;
and Fra Luca urged him to order his manuscripts and give
them to the public. He even offered to find him an editor.
Leonardo, however, refused, and remained firm in his resolution
that he would publish nothing. Yet all his writings were
couched in the form of address to a reader; and at the commencement
of one of his diaries he apologised in these words
for the disconnected style and frequent repetitions:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Blame me not, O reader, for the subjects are numberless
and my memory is weak, and I write at long intervals in
different years.'</p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>In the last days of March disquieting tidings reached the
Villa Melzi. The French army, led by Monsieur de la
Tr&#233;mouille, had crossed the Alps and was descending for the
reconquest of Milan. Il Moro, suspicious of all, and
oppressed by superstitious fears, dared not meet the enemy
in the open field, and daily showed himself <i>più pauroso d'una
donniccuola</i>, 'more panic-stricken than a silly girl.'
</p><p>
But at the villa news of the great world seemed but a faint
and far off hum. Careless of duke and king, Leonardo
roamed the neighbouring hills and glens and woods, accompanied
only by the little Francesco. Sometimes they ascended
the river to its source among the pine-clad mountains; and
there they hired workmen and made excavations, seeking
fossil shells and plants.
</p><p>
One evening, wearied by a long day's march, they rested
under an old lime-tree, overhanging the steep bank of the
Adda. The unbounded plain, with its long rows of wayside
poplars, lay stretched at their feet. The white houses of
Bergamo shone in the evening sunlight: the snowy mountain-tops
seemed to float in the air. All the sky was clear, save
that in the far distance, almost on the horizon, between
Treviglio, Brignano, and Castel Rozzone, there suddenly
appeared a light cloud of smoke.
</p><p>
'What is it?' asked Francesco.
</p><p>
'I know not. It may be a battle. I see what may be
fire, and think I hear the sound of cannon. It may be a
skirmish between our folk and the French.'
</p><p>
Latterly, such chance encounters had not been infrequent.
They watched the cloud silently for a few minutes, then
turned their attention to the fruit of their day's digging. The
master picked up a large bone, sharp as a needle, the fin of
some primeval fish.
</p><p>
'How many kings, how many nations has not time
destroyed since this creature fell on its sleep in that great
cavern, where to-day we have found it? How many thousands
of years has the world seen, what changes have taken
place, while it was lying hid, concealed from all eyes, supporting
heavy masses of earth with its bare skeleton?'
</p><p>
He made a large gesture with his hand, as if to embrace
the verdant plain stretched at their feet; then continued:&mdash;</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>

'All that you see, Francesco, was once the bed of an ocean
which covered the chief parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia;
the summits of the Apennines were islands in a great sea,
and fishes swam in these fields of singing birds.'
</p><p>
He interrupted himself, and they looked once more at the
distant smoke-drift, and the flashes of fire from the cannon, so
insignificant in the boundless expanse, which lay all peaceful
and rose-tinted in the sunset glow. It was hard to believe
that a fight was taking place, and that men were killing each
other almost within range of their eyesight. More vivid to
Francesco were the birds flying to roost, the fish of that forgotten
sea. Neither spoke, but at that moment the painter
and the child had the same thought:&mdash;
</p><p>
''Tis a small matter whether the Lombards prevail or the
Frenchmen; Ludovico the duke, or Louis the foreign king;
our own people or the strangers. Country, glory, war, the
strife of policy, the fall of thrones, the upheaval of nations,
all that to man seems great or terrible&mdash;all are no more than
yonder little cloud of smoke, melting into the peaceful twilight,
dissolving in the immutable serenity of Nature.'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>It was at Vaprio that Leonardo finished a picture begun
long ago at Florence. In a cavern, surrounded by great
rocks, the Mother of God was folding one arm round the
infant John the Baptist, with the other clasping her Son,
as if she desired to unite the Human and the Divine in the
indissoluble embrace of a single love. John, devoutly joining
his little hands, bent his knee before Jesus, who blessed
him with two fingers raised. The attitude of the infant
Saviour, sitting naked on the naked earth, one plump dimpled
leg tucked under the other, while he leaned on a plump hand,
all its fingers outspread upon the sand&mdash;suggested the baby
still unable to walk; yet already on his face, perfect wisdom
was blent with the simplicity of infancy. A kneeling angel
supporting the little Jesus, and pointing at the Precursor,
turned to the spectator a face instinct with mournful foreboding,
yet illumined by a strange and tender smile. Behind
the rocks a pale sun shone through drizzling rain, and
blue mountains rose into the sky, their sharp peaks weird
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
and unearthly; the rocks, smoothed and polished as if by the
action of salt water, suggested some dried-up ocean bed;
and in the cavern was most profound shadow, almost concealing
a bubbling spring, leaves of water-plants, pale dim cups
of purple iris-flowers. One could fancy slow tricklings and
droppings from the overhanging arch of black dolomite; and
the creeping weeds and grasses were heavy with the continuous
ooze of the ground and the damp saturation of the air. The
face of the Madonna alone shone with the delicate brilliance
of alabaster within which glows a light. Queen of Heaven,
she was shown to men in the gloom of twilight, in a subterranean
cavern, in the most secret of the recesses of nature,
perhaps the last refuge of ancient Pan and the wood nymphs&mdash;she,
the mystery of mysteries, the mother of the God-man,
in the very bosom of mother earth.
</p><p>
It was the creation at once of a great artist and of a great
student; the play of light and of shadow, the laws of vegetable
life, the anatomy of the human body, the science of drapery,
the spirals of a woman's curls (which he had compared to
the circling of a whirlpool), all that the natural philosopher
had searched into with 'unrelenting severity,' had measured
with mathematical accuracy, had dissected as one dissects a
corpse&mdash;all this the artist had recombined into a new creation,
living beauty, a silent melody; into a mystic hymn to the
Holy Virgin, the Mother of God. With knowledge equalled
by love he had depicted the veins in the iris petals, the dimples
in the baby's elbow, the ancient cleft in the dolomite rock,
the quiver of the water in the secret spring; the quiver of
infinite grief in the angel's smile. He knew all and loved
all. Great love is the daughter of great knowledge.</p>

<p>One day the alchemist, Messer Galeotto Sacrobosco, undertook
to experiment with the 'Rod of Mercury,' under which
name were known all those staves of myrtle, almond, tamarind,
or other 'astrological' woods, which were supposed to have
a kinship with metals, and the property of discovering veins
of gold, silver, and copper in the rocks. Accompanied by
Messer Gerolamo, he went to the east side of the lake of
Lecco, known to be rich in ores; and Leonardo joined the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
company, though he had no faith in the 'Rod of Mercury,'
and mocked at it no less than at the other delusions of the
alchemists.
</p><p>
Near the village of Mandello, at the foot of Monte
Campione, there was an abandoned iron mine. Some years
before the ground had fallen in and buried a number of the
miners; and it was reported that sulphurous exhalations rose
from a rent in the lowest depths of the mine, into which, if a
stone were thrown, it fell, and fell, and fell, but was never
heard to strike the bottom, for the sufficient reason that the
pit was bottomless. Leonardo's curiosity was excited by
these tales, and he determined to explore the mine while his
companions were busied with the magic rod. Not without
difficulty, for the peasants believed the mine to be the dwelling-place
of a devil, he obtained the services of an old man
as guide. A subterranean passage, very steep and dark, and
with broken and slippery stairs, led to the central shaft. The
guide walked stolidly in front with a lantern, and Leonardo
followed, carrying Francesco, who had insisted on accompanying
his friend. They descended more than two hundred steps,
and were still going down, the passage becoming ever narrower
and more steep. A stifling smell of subterranean damp assailed
the nostrils. Leonardo struck the wall with a spade, listened
to the sound it made, and examined the piece of rock he had
detached, the nature and layers of the soil, and the bright
mica sparkling in the veins of granite.
</p><p>
He felt the child clinging to him very tightly, and he asked
with a smile whether his little comrade were afraid.
</p><p>
'With you, I am never afraid,' said Francesco; presently
he added shyly, 'is it true what my <i>babbo</i> says, that you are
going to leave us?'
</p><p>
'Yes, Francesco.'
</p><p>
'Where are you going?'
</p><p>
'To Romagna; to the Duke Valentino.'
</p><p>
'Is it very far?'
</p><p>
'Several days' journey.'
</p><p>
'Several days!' sighed Francesco; 'then shall we never
see you again?'
</p><p>
'Why not? The first minute I can, I will come and see
you.'
</p><p>
The boy became thoughtful. Squeezing Leonardo's neck
tightly with his two arms, he cried:&mdash;</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>

'Take me with you! Oh, Messer Leonardo, take me with
you.'
</p><p>
'Alack, my child! How is it possible? There is war
there.'
</p><p>
'I don't care for the war. Have I not said that with you
I am never afraid? Even if it be more fearsome than it is in
this place where we are now, I shall not be afraid. I will be
your servant, brush your clothes, carry hay to your horses;
and I will seek shells for you, and make you drawings of
leaves. Did you not say to me I drew them well? I will do
everything like a man. I will obey you in whatever you
command. Take me with you, Messer Leonardo!'
</p><p>
'And how about Messer Gerolamo? Would he consent?'
</p><p>
'He will consent if I cry for it. And if he doesn't consent,
then I will run away. Say you will take me with you!
Say it!'
</p><p>
'No, Francesco; it is idle talk. I know thou would'st
not leave thy father. He grows old, and thou must have a
fondness for him.'
</p><p>
'Of a surety I have a fondness for him. But for you, too,
Messer Leonardo! You think me very little, but truly I comprehend
everything. Aunt Bona says you are a sorcerer, and
Don Lorenzo, my schoolmaster, says it likewise, and that you
are wicked, and that with you I shall lose my soul. But when
he speaks ill of you, I answer him in such wise that he comes
near beating me.'
</p><p>
Suddenly Francesco's eyes filled and the corners of his lips
drooped.
</p><p>
'I understand,' he said; 'I understand why you don't
want me. You don't love me. And I&mdash;&mdash;.' He burst into
tears.
</p><p>
'Hush! hush! Thou should'st cry shame to weep!
Hearken to what I tell thee. In a few years, when thou
art grown, then I will take thee for my disciple, and keep
thee always at my side.'
</p><p>
The child raised his eyes, tears still trembling on their long
lashes.
</p><p>
'But do you mean it? or is it said to comfort me, and
afterwards will you forget?'
</p><p>
'No, Francesco, I promise.'
</p><p>
'You promise? And how long must I wait?'
</p><p>
'Eight or nine years; till thou art at the least fifteen.'</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>

'Eight years,' sighed the child, reckoning on his fingers
'and I shall be always with you?'
</p><p>
'Unless we die.'
</p><p>
'Eight years! Well, if you say it, it is certain.'
</p><p>
Francesco smiled, and rubbed his cheek against Leonardo's
with a pretty gesture peculiar to himself.
</p><p>
'Messer Leonardo, once I dreamed I was in the dark,
going down a long, long stair like this one, only it had no
beginning and no end. But I was not frightened, for some
one was carrying me. I thought it was my mother, who
died ere ever I saw her; but now I know it was you. I am
as happy with you as if I was with her.'
</p><p>
Leonardo looked at the child with inexpressible tenderness.
The innocent eyes shone; he put out his bright lips as confidingly
as to a mother, and when Leonardo kissed them he
felt the child was giving him his soul. Thus, with the little
heart beating against his own, he descended with firm steps
into the subterranean night.</p>

<p>
Upon their return to Vaprio they found alarm in the villa;
the French were approaching. Louis, furious at the revolt of
the Milanese, had given their city over to pillage. Many
of the inhabitants fled to the mountains. Along the road
was an endless procession of carts laden with household
stuff, and of weeping women dragging children by the hand.
At night, from the top windows of the villa, flames were
still seen citywards. At Novara a battle was daily expected
which should decide the fate of Lombardy.
</p><p>
At last Fra Luca brought news of the sad event which had
ended the war. The battle was ordered on the 10th of April,
but when the duke was reviewing his forces, prior to its commencement,
the Swiss mercenaries refused to advance, for
they had been secretly bought by Trivulzio. In vain Il Moro
conjured them with tears not to bring him to ruin, and
promised them extravagant reward in recompense for fidelity.
They remained obdurate.
</p><p>
Then Ludovico, disguised as a monk, sought to flee; but a
Swiss named Schattenhalb betrayed him to the French
captains. He was seized and carried before the marshal,
who rewarded the Swiss with thirty pieces of silver.</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>

The Sire de la Tr&#233;mouille had charge of the prisoner to
escort him to France. He, who, in the words of the court
poet, 'first after God had guided the wheel of Fortune,' was
placed in a barred cage and carried in a cart, like a trapped
wild beast. The duke asked one favour of his captors, that
he might carry a copy of the <i>Divina Commedia</i> with him
into his exile, '<i>per istudiari</i>.'
</p><p>
Life at the Villa Melzi became daily more perilous. The
French had sacked Lomellina. The Venetians had destroyed
the Martesana. Robbers roamed in the neighbourhood of
Vaprio; already Messer Gerolamo Melzi was preparing to
carry Francesco and Aunt Bona into refuge at Chiavenna.
</p><p>
Leonardo's last night came; he inscribed in his diary the
thoughts of the day:&mdash;
</p><p>
'A bird having little tail but broad wings, flaps them with
great violence, and turns <i>so that the wind may blow under
them</i> and raise her <i>aloft</i>. This I observed watching a young
hawk above the canonry of Vaprio, on the road to Bergamo,
to-day, April 14th.'
</p><p>
And in the margin he added incidentally: 'Il Moro has
lost his state, his goods, and his liberty; not one of his undertakings
will be achieved by himself.'
</p><p>
The overthrow of the great house of Sforza, the ruin of
the man he had served for sixteen years, were to him of far
less interest than the flight of a bird of prey.</p>

<h3 class="p2">I</h3>

<p>The little town of Vinci, Leonardo's native place, lay on the
western slope of Monte Albano, in Tuscany, between Florence
and Pisa, and not far from Empoli. There he had an uncle,
Ser Francesco da Vinci, who had amassed wealth in the silk
industry, and who, unlike the rest of the family, was friendly
to his nephew. Before journeying to Romagna the painter
proposed to visit Ser Francesco, and if possible to leave
Astro in his charge, the unfortunate smith not yet having
recovered from the effects of his fall. Leonardo hoped
that the mountain air, with quiet and rest, might accomplish
more for him than the drugs and experimental surgery
of ignorant physicians. The artist, who had been in Florence
for a few days, journeyed to Vinci alone, riding a mule. He
left the town by the Porta a Prato, and took his way
along the banks of the Arno; at Empoli he left the high road
and followed a narrow and winding mountain path. The day
had been clouded and cool; at evening the sun set in a bank
of mist which foreboded a north wind. The prospect on
either side continually widened; the hills became higher;
and though their undulations were still gentle, they gave
promise of higher mountains behind. The ground was
carpeted with scanty herbage of a dull green; and the fields,
with fallow stripes of brown earth, the stone walls, the grey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
olives were all dull and whitish in tone, suggestive of the
calm, the simplicity, the poverty of the north. Here and
there in the distance, beside some solitary chapel or farmhouse
with yellow walls and barred windows, dark pointed
cypresses, such as may be seen in the pictures by early
Florentine masters, rose against quiet hills and an even
background of clear, delicately gradated sky.
</p><p>
The path became gradually steeper, the air fresher and
more invigorating. Sant' Ausano, Calistri, Lucardi, and the
Chapel of San Giovanni were already past. Now the day
closed, and one by one the stars came out in the blue sky,
from which the clouds had disappeared. The wind freshened;
the <i>tramontana</i>, that piercing wind from the Alps, was
beginning to blow. Every appearance of the lowlands had
vanished; as the plain had passed into hills, so now the hills
passed into mountains. Quite suddenly, at a turn of the
road, Vinci came in sight, a little, crowded, stone-built town,
clustering round the black tower of its ancient castle, clinging
to the rock, crowning the peaked summit of a low but
sharply precipitous hill. Lights were gleaming in the windows
of the houses.
</p><p>
At the cross-roads near the foot of the hill there was a
little shrine known to Leonardo from his earliest childhood;
a clay image of the Virgin glazed in blue and white, before
which a lamp burned continually. As he passed he saw a
woman kneeling, bowed together dejectedly, covering her
face with her hands, a poor peasant woman, in a thin dark
dress, torn and weather-stained.
</p><p>
'Caterina!' murmured Leonardo. It was his mother's
name; she too had prayed here, a poor peasant.
</p><p>
After crossing the swift mountain stream, the path turned
to the right between garden walls overgrown with weeds.
Here it was quite dark, and the traveller did not see the rose-branch
which kissed his face as he passed, and scented the
air with balm. He dismounted at an ancient wooden door
let into the wall, and knocked with a stone on the iron cramp.
It was the house which had belonged to Leonardo's grandfather,
and from him had passed to Ser Francesco. The
painter himself had spent his childhood within its walls. No
one answered the knock, nor was there for a long time any
sound but the rushing of the mill-stream, and presently the
quavering bark of an old watch-dog.</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>

An old man came out, very much bowed and wrinkled,
with silvery hair. He carried a lantern, and was very deaf
and rather stupid, so that it took him time to understand who
Leonardo was.
</p><p>
However, when at last he recognised him whom he had
carried in his arms forty years earlier, he burst into tears of
joy, dropped his lantern, and, stooping over the painter's
hand, mumbled it with his lips, sobbing out:&mdash;
</p><p>
'<i>O Signore! Signore! Leonardo mio!</i>'&mdash;while the dog
wagged his tail to please the old gardener, pretending that
he clearly comprehended what was taking place. Gian
Battista, the old man, explained that Ser Francesco was
away at Marcigliano, where a monk of his acquaintance had
promised a drug to cure him of the stomach-ache; he would
not be home for two days. Leonardo determined, however,
to wait for him; more especially because next day Boltraffio
was to bring up Zoroastro from Florence.
</p><p>
The old man ushered the visitor into the house, and bade
his grand-daughter, a pretty fair-haired girl of sixteen, to
prepare supper. Leonardo declined anything but bread,
home-grown wine, and iron-water from the spring on the
property. Ser Francesco, though well-to-do, continued the
hardy, simple style of living which had been a necessity to
his forefathers, and his house was anything but luxurious.
</p><p>
Leonardo entered the familiar apartment, at once kitchen
and parlour, where the few clumsy chairs, settles, and chests
had become smooth and polished with age; a dresser carried
heavy pewter dinner-plates, and medicinal herbs were hanging
from the beams of the raftered ceiling. The walls were
whitewashed, and quite bare; there was a brick floor, and
an immense fireplace begrimed with soot.
</p><p>
All this was as Leonardo remembered it, but there was
one innovation; thick dull green glass had been inserted in
the window-panes, formerly covered only with oiled cloth,
causing twilight in the room on the brightest day. Upstairs,
in the sleeping rooms, the windows were protected by
wooden shutters, which did not fit close enough to keep out
the cold.
</p><p>
The gardener made a fire of fragrant juniper and mountain
heather, and lit a hanging earthenware lamp, in shape much
like the lamps found in Etruscan tombs. In this remote corner
of Tuscany the furniture, the customs, even the language had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
preserved traces of immemorial antiquity. While the young
girl was preparing the supper of wine, bread, and a lettuce
salad, Leonardo mounted to the upper rooms, where little
had been changed since his last visit. He saw the same
immense four-poster bed, in which his grandmother had
sometimes permitted him to sleep, and which had now
passed, with the other heirlooms, to his uncle Francesco. On
the wall hung the well-remembered crucifix, the image of the
Madonna, the shell for holy water, a bunch of dried grass,
called <i>nebbia</i>, and a book of Latin prayers in cursive script,
written on paper deeply yellowed by time.
</p><p>
Returning to the parlour, he sat in the chimney-corner,
drank from a wooden cup with a pleasant scent of olive-wood,
and remaining in the room alone, after Gian and his grand-daughter
had gone to bed, abandoned himself to happy
recollections.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>II</h3>

<p>He thought of his father, Ser Piero da Vinci, the notary of
the Florentine Commune, a man of seventy, white-haired,
but still vigorous, whom he had seen a few days ago at
Florence, in his house in the Via Ghibellina. No one had
ever loved life better than Ser Piero, with a love simple and
unabashed. He had cherished a great tenderness for his
first-born, but his legitimate sons, Antonio and Giuliano,
fearing lest their father should alienate part of his patrimony
in favour of the bastard, had done all in their power to
induce bad blood between them.
</p><p>
Leonardo now felt himself a stranger in his father's house.
His youngest half-brother, Antonio, was more especially
prejudiced against him on account of his supposed atheism,
for Antonio was one of the Piagnoni, a zealous and rigid
follower of Savonarola, and also a conventional, virtuous, and
money-loving trader of the guild of the woolstaplers.
Antonio often addressed his half-brother on the subject of
the Christian faith, the need for repentance, the heresies of
the philosophical thinkers of the day, and he had given him
a book compiled by himself, a <i>Manual of the Art of Saving
the Soul</i>. Leonardo carried this book in his pocket, and
now, seated in his uncle's chimney-corner, he drew it forth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
It was a little volume, written in the small laborious hand
which befitted a merchant's office.
</p><p>
'The book of confession compiled by me, Antonio di Ser
Pietro da Vinci, a Florentine, sent to Nanna, my sister-in-law;
most useful to all who desire to confess their sins.'
</p><p>
For Leonardo, his brother's book breathed the air of conventional
and bourgeois piety, which had weighed upon his
childhood, and had been an inheritance in his family. A
century before his birth the founders of the house of Vinci
were just as prudent, just as avaricious, just as pious servants
of the Florentine Commune as was now Ser Pietro, his father.
Their name appeared first in a writing of 1339, where mention
was made of one Michele da Vinci, a notary. Leonardo
imagined him like Antonio, his well-remembered grandfather.
Antonio instructed his sons to aspire to nothing over high, not
to fame, nor to honours, nor to public office, civil or military,
nor to exceptional wealth, nor to exceptional learning.
</p><p>
'<i>Starsi mezzanamente è cosa più sicura</i>,' ''Tis safest to keep
the mean,' was his constant saw; and Leonardo remembered
the gravity and calm assurance with which he enunciated
this infallible rule.
</p><p>
After thirty years' absence, sitting under the roof of his
grandfather's house, listening to the moaning wind and
watching the logs burning in the fireplace, Leonardo thought
how his own life had been one long breach of this 'ant and
spider' policy; had been an exuberant blossoming which,
according to his brother Antonio, temperance should have
measured with compasses and shorn away with iron shears.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Next morning, before the old gardener was awake, Leonardo
left the house, and having traversed the poor little town
of Vinci ascended to Anchiano, the neighbouring hamlet.
The path was steep, and as on the previous day, the sun
colourless and wintry. At the verge of the horizon, the cold
cloudless blue of the sky melted into a dull purple. The
<i>tramontana</i> blew steadily from the north, whistling monotonously
in the ears. The vegetation was still colourless and
poor; little meagre vineyards in semicircles, sparse dull grasses,
mingled with fluttering poppies; on all sides dusty grey
olives, with knotted, blackened, and twisted trunks of great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
antiquity. Entering Anchiano, Leonardo halted, for he did
not recognise the place. Where had been the Castello degli
Adimari with a wine-shop in its only unruined tower, there
was now a vineyard and a new house, with smoothly whitewashed
walls. A husbandman digging trenches among the
vines, explained that mine host of the tavern having died,
the land had been sold to a sheepbreeder from Orbignano,
who had cleared away the ruins, and made a vineyard and an
olive-grove on their site.
</p><p>
Leonardo had good reason to ask after that little tavern,
for it was there he had been born.
</p><p>
Fifty years earlier, the village wine-shop had been lively
enough. It stood a little back from the road, its signboard
swinging merrily. The inhabitants of the surrounding
hamlets on their way to the fairs of San Miniato or Fucecchio,
chamois-hunters, mule-drivers, custom-house officers, and
other persons who were not too exclusive in their taste for
company&mdash;all met here. The maid of the tavern was a girl
of sixteen, an orphan, a <i>contadina</i> from Vinci; her name
Caterina.
</p><p>
One day, in the spring-time of 1451, Piero di Ser Antonio
da Vinci, a young notary from Florence, was called to
Anchiano to draw up an agreement for the lease of the sixth
part of a certain oil-press. Business concluded, the peasants
invited the notary to drink at the tavern in the old tower of
the Adimari. Ser Piero, always affable, even among simple
folk, accepted the invitation. The party was served by
Caterina, and the young notary, as he afterwards confessed,
became enamoured at first sight. Under pretext of quail-shooting,
he delayed his return to Florence; he haunted the
tavern, and laid siege to Caterina. Ser Piero was already
celebrated as a conqueror of women; he was four-and-twenty,
handsome, strong, something of a coxcomb. He possessed
that self-confident eloquence which in a lover is irresistible.
Caterina hesitated, prayed to the Virgin for assistance, finally
succumbed. At the time when the quails took their flight
from the Val di Nievole, she was with child.
</p><p>
Ser Antonio da Vinci soon learned that his son had
entangled himself with the maid-servant at a village hostelry.
He despatched him to Florence and wedded him as quickly as
possible to Madonna Albiera di Ser Giovanni Amadori, who
was neither very young nor very fair, but had a substantial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
dowry. Caterina he mated also with a peasant named
Accattabrighe di Piero del Vacca, who was said to have
beaten his first wife to death in a drunken fit. The girl
resigned herself without protest, but with inward grief which
threw her into a fever when she was brought to bed. She
was unable to suckle her child, and the little Leonardo was
wet-nursed by a goat from Monte Albano. Piero, however,
begged his father to take Caterina's child to be bred in his
house. In those times no one was ashamed of bastards, and
they were frequently educated on the same footing as their
legitimate brethren, and even preferred to them. Leonardo
accordingly entered the virtuous and pious family of da Vinci,
and was entrusted to the care of his grandmother, Lena di
Piero da Baccareto.
</p><p>
As the vision of a dream, Leonardo remembered his
mother; more especially her smile, so delicate, so fleeting, full
of mystery, and gently malicious; singularly in contrast with
the habitual expression of her beautiful but melancholy face,
which to some seemed even harshly severe. Once he found
that smile again, on the face of a small antique bronze statue
of Cybele, the immemorially ancient goddess of the earth;
the same subtle smile which he remembered as the characteristic
of the young peasant woman of Vinci&mdash;his mother.
</p><p>
He thought:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Ah, how the mountain women, dressed in poor coarse
raiment, excel in beauty those who are adorned!'
</p><p>
It was said by persons who had known Caterina that her
son resembled her; his long and slender hands, his golden
hair, his smile, were inherited from her. From his father he
had a powerful frame, health, zest of life; from his mother
that almost feminine charm. Brought up in the paternal
house, Leonardo had never been entirely separated from his
mother. Her cottage was not far from Ser Antonio's villa;
and at mid-day when Accattabrighe had gone forth with the
oxen, the boy would make his way through the vineyard,
climb the wall, and run to his mother. She was awaiting him
on the threshold, distaff in hand; she stretched out her arms,
and when he came she covered his eyes, his lips, his hair with
her kisses. Or at night when Accattabrighe would be at the
tavern, dicing and swilling, the child would escape from his
bed, crawl through the window and down the fig-tree, and
run to Caterina's home. Sweet to him was the cool of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
dewy grass, the cry of the night-jar, the very nettles and stones
which wounded his feet; the glow of the far-off stars, and the
very anxiety lest his grandam should awake and miss him.
</p><p>
Yet Monna Lena likewise loved and pampered her grandson,
and he remembered her well, her one vesture of dark
brown, her white kerchief, her dark, wrinkled, kind old face,
her lullabies, and the appetising odour of the 'berlingozzi'
which she baked after the ancient Tuscan recipe. With his
grandfather, he had not agreed so well. At first Ser Antonio
had taught him personally; but Leonardo was an unwilling
pupil, and at seven he was sent to school at the Oratory of
Santa Petronilla. But neither was the Latin grammar to his
liking. He played truant, wandering to a wild ravine behind
the town where he would lie on his back watching the flight
of the cranes with torturing envy; or unfolding the cups of
flowers, wondering at their coloured petals and pollen-covered
stamens, moist with honey. Sometimes during his grandfather's
absence the little Nardo would escape for whole
days into the mountains, making his way by the tracks
of goats and along the edges of precipices to the summit of
Monte Albano. Thence he could see a boundless expanse
of meadows, pastures, groves, and forests; the marshes of
Fucecchio; and Prato, Pistoia, Florence, and the snowy
peaks of the Alps; when the sky was clear, the misty blue
of the Mediterranean Sea. At last he would return home,
dusty, sunburnt, his hands scratched, his garments torn; but
his grandam, seeing his happiness, had not the heart to
punish him, or to betray him to Ser Antonio. The boy lived
alone; his father and his uncle Francesco he saw but seldom,
for they were away in Florence; with his schoolmates he did
not associate. Their sports displeased him; on one occasion
when they tore the wings from a butterfly and laughed at
its writhings, he frowned, turned pale, and went away.
Complaints of his surliness were in consequence made to
Ser Antonio; great displeasure followed, threats of flogging,
and an actual imprisonment for three days in a cupboard
under the staircase.
</p><p>
Later, recalling this link in a long chain of injustice, he
wrote in his diary:&mdash;
</p><p>
'If as a child you were put in prison for doing your duty,
what will they do to you as a man?'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Not far from Vinci a large villa was in course of construction
by the Florentine architect, Biagio da Ravenna, a pupil
of Alberti. Leonardo watched the raising of the walls, the
levelling of the stonework, the elevation of huge blocks by
machinery. One day Ser Biagio talked with the lad, and was
astonished by the understanding which he showed. At first
in jest, then seriously, he taught him the first principles of
arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and mechanics. The teacher
marvelled at the facility with which the boy caught each idea as
it were on the wing, and made it his own; it seemed as though
he were not learning but remembering. The grandfather
looked askance at what he called 'caprices,' and he thought
it a bad omen that the boy used preferably his left hand when
he wrote; for sorcerers, necromancers, and those who make
compacts with the devil are, of course, always born left-handed!
His suspicion of the lad increased when a neighbour
from Fortuniano assured him that the old woman of the
village on Monte Albano who had provided the black goat
for the suckling of the babe was an undoubted witch.
</p><p>
'Do what you will,' thought the old notary, 'but if you
bring up a wolf he will always have his eye on the forest.
Well, well! Submit to the will of Heaven! There's no
family without <i>one</i> abortion.'
</p><p>
And he waited with desperate anxiety for the birth of a
legitimate heir to Piero, his favourite son; since Nardo, the
product of illicit love, was showing himself thus clearly 'ill-born'
into this eminently respectable family. 'Twas a tale of
Monte Albano, which indeed accounted for its name, that
many plants and animals there mysteriously changed their
natural colour into white; so that the traveller, roaming its
woods and meadows, would chance upon white violets, white
strawberries, white sparrows, white nestlings in a brood of
blackbirds. In like manner the little Nardo was one of the
wonders of the White Mountain; a changeling in the virtuous
and commonplace family of the Florentine notary; a big
white cuckoo in a nest of blackbirds.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>V</h3>

<p>When the boy had reached the age of thirteen, his father
removed him from Vinci to his house. Florence; since then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
he had rarely visited his birthplace. But long after, in one of
his note-books of the year 1494, when he was in the service
of the Duke of Milan, he wrote, 'Caterina, came in July
last year.' It might signify the beginning of some kitchen
wench's service; in reality it referred to his mother. Her
husband had died, and feeling that her own time might be
short, she desired to see her son at least once again. She
joined a party of pilgrims on their way to Milan for adoration
of the Holy Nail; journeyed from Tuscany, and presented
herself at Leonardo's house. He received her with pious
affection; for her he was ever the little Nardo, who had come
secretly by night with bare feet and nestled at her side.
</p><p>
She would have returned to Anchiano, but her son would
not permit it. He placed her in a quiet and commodiously-fitted
cell of the Convent of Santa Chiara, near the Porta
Vercellina. Later she fell ill, and at her own request was
taken to the <i>Ospedale Maggiore</i>, built by Francesco Sforza
and the finest hospital in Milan. Here he visited her for
months every day, at the last scarcely leaving her for an hour.
Yet he had told none of his friends nor even his pupils of
her presence in Milan.
</p><p>
But when for the last time he had pressed his lips on the
cold hand of this peasant woman who had been his mother,
it seemed to him that to her he owed everything. He
honoured her with a sumptuous funeral.
</p><p>
Six years later, after the fall of Ludovico Sforza, when he
was leaving Milan, he found a small carefully wrapped bundle
in one of his chests. It contained a couple of coarse canvas
shirts and three pair of goats'-hair stockings, all made by
Caterina's hand, and brought to him from Vinci. He had
never worn them, but now coming upon the poor things
among his scientific books and mechanical apparatus, and
the garments of fine linen to which he had habituated
himself, he felt inexpressibly touched. Nor in the years
which followed, when he was a solitary and weary wanderer
from country to country, from town to town, did he ever omit
to take this poor little parcel with him, packed among the
dearest of his treasures.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Such were Leonardo's recollections as he climbed the
slopes of Monte Albano, familiar to him in his childhood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
He sat down under the shelter of a rock and surveyed the
well-remembered landscape. Dwarfed and gnarled oak-trees
surrounded him still hung with withered leaves, perfumed
juniper, which the peasants called <i>scopa</i> (besom), pale shy
violets, and low bushes of dried mountain heather, exhaled
that intangible freshness which is the odour of spring. Far
away the valley of the Arno met the sky; but to the right
rose bare lofty mountains with undulating shadows, twisted
hollows like gigantic serpents, and wide ravines, delicate
purple in colour. At his feet was Anchiano, white and
shining in the sunlight; further away, Vinci clung to its little
conical hill like a wasp's nest; the castle tower distinct and
black as the two cypresses by the side of the Anchiano road.
</p><p>
Nothing was changed since the day when he had first
climbed these paths. Forty years before the <i>scopa</i> had
grown as luxuriantly, the violets and thyme had scented
the air, the oaks had rustled their withered leaves; as now,
Monte Albano had seemed colourless, bare, northern. Etruria
of the ancients, now Tuscany, land of perpetual spring,
land of unfailing renaissance&mdash;to Leonardo it wore that
subtle and tender smile brightening a beauty otherwise too
austere, which he had first seen on the countenance of
Caterina his peasant mother.
</p><p>
He rose and pursued his way, the path growing more
rugged, the wind colder, sharper, more northerly. Memories
of his youth crowded upon his soul.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Ser Piero da Vinci had prospered. Skilful and good-hearted,
his life ran upon greased wheels. Live and let live,
was his maxim, and he stood well with all, more especially
with the clerical party. Procurator of the monastery of the
Santissima Annunziata, and of many other rich foundations,
he acquired wealth in abundance, adding largely to his
property, but never changing the modest fashion of life which
he had learned from Ser Antonio. His wife died when he
was eight-and-thirty, but he soon married a young and beautiful
girl, Madonna Francesca di Ser Giovanni Lanfredini.
She, like her predecessor, was childless; and Leonardo, the
bastard, lived with his father, and had every prospect of
becoming his heir.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
At that time Paola dal Pozzo Toscanelli, a famous
astronomer and mathematician, lived at Florence. He had
written a letter to Christopher Columbus, assuring him on
the authority of his calculations that the route to India by
the Antipodes was neither so long nor so arduous as had
been supposed, encouraging him to make the adventure, and
prophesying its success. Columbus therefore carried out
what had been conceived in the lonely cell of the Florentine
scholar, and was, as it were, the instrument played by the
hand of a skilled musician. Toscanelli was said by his
contemporaries to 'live like a saint'; reserved, frugal, chaste,
he frequented neither the brilliant Medicean court, nor the
vain assemblies of the Neo-Platonist imitators of antiquity.
His face was curiously ugly, but redeemed by eyes of great
brilliance.
</p><p>
One evening a lad, scarcely more than a child, knocked at
his door and was coldly received, being suspected of mere
idle curiosity. But short conversation with the young
Leonardo&mdash;for it was he&mdash;convinced the astronomer, as
before it had convinced Biagio da Ravenna, of his wonderful
aptitude for mathematics. Ser Paola became his teacher;
on summer nights they went together to Poggio del Pino,
one of those fragrant, pine-clad, heather-carpeted hills,
girdling the City of Flowers; there Toscanelli had built his
observatory. He taught the boy all he himself knew of the
laws of the universe. It was from these lessons that
Leonardo dated his faith in the experimental study of nature,
as yet too much neglected by the philosophers.
</p><p>
Ser Piero da Vinci, though he put no difficulties in the
way of his son's studies, advised him to choose some more
lucrative occupation; having noticed his bent towards
modelling and drawing, he showed some of the boy's work to
Andrea Verrocchio, the painter and goldsmith; and shortly
afterwards Leonardo was formally entered as one of this
artist's pupils.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Verrocchio, the son of a poor furnace-stoker, was seventeen
years the senior of Leonardo. His face was placid, flat, and
pale, with a double chin. Only in his tight shut lips and
piercing eyes was there evidence of singular intelligence.
Spectacles on nose, magnifier in hand, he sat in his dark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
<i>bottega</i> near the Ponte Vecchio, looking more like a small
shopkeeper than a great artist. A disciple of Paolo Uccello,
he, like his master, affirmed that Perspective must be based
on science. 'Geometry,' he said, 'being a part of mathematics,
mother of all knowledge, is also the mother of
drawing, which is the father of all the arts.' Complete
knowledge and complete enjoyment of beauty were to him
identical. Unlike Botticelli, and others of his kidney,
Verrocchio was neither ravished by extraordinary beauty nor
repelled by unusual deformity. In both he found occasion
for study. He was also the first master who made anatomical
models. If Botticelli had found the fascination of art in the
miraculous, in the fabulous, in that mystic haze which confounds
Olympus with Golgotha&mdash;for Verrocchio it lay in
patient investigation and a firm grasp of the verities of nature.
The miraculous was not true for him. Truth was the
miracle.
</p><p>
This was the man to whom Ser Piero brought his seventeen-year-old
son; he became Leonardo's teacher; further, he
became his disciple. The monks of Vallombrosa had commissioned
Ser Andrea to paint them a Baptism of Christ,
and the master set his pupil to execute the kneeling angel
which formed part of the composition. The result showed
Verrocchio that his scholar knew intuitively and clearly all
that he himself had dimly guessed and sought for gropingly,
slowly and laboriously, through a fog.
</p><p>
Later it was said that Verrocchio gave up painting because
jealous of the young man's superiority; in reality there was
never anything but harmony between the two. Each supplied
the deficiency of the other. The pupil had lightness and
precision of touch; Verrocchio, perseverance and concentrated
attention. They worked together without envy, without
rivalry, scarce knowing how much they owed each other.
</p><p>
At that time Verrocchio executed the bronze group for
Orsanmichele, which was known as the 'Incredulity of St.
Thomas.' It was altogether unlike the celestial dreams of
the Beato Angelico or the delirious idealism of Sandro
Botticelli. In St. Thomas's mysterious smile, as he put his
fingers into the print of the nails, was exhibited for the
first time the boldness of man before his God; Reason face
to face with Miracle.
</p>
<hr class="chap" />
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span></p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Leonardo's first independent work was a cartoon for a
curtain of Flanders tissue, a gift from the Florentines to the
King of Portugal. The subject was the Fall of Man; and
such was the accuracy with which the palm branches, the
flowers, and the animals of Paradise were drawn, that Vasari
the critic was stupefied at so great patience.
</p><p>
Eve, stretching out her hand to the Tree of Knowledge,
wore the same smile of bold curiosity which Verrocchio had
given to St. Thomas.
</p><p>
A little later Ser Piero employed his son to paint one of
those round wooden shields called <i>rotelle</i>, which were used
as ornaments for houses, and which generally carried some
allegorical design. Leonardo painted an animal, terrible as
the face of Medusa. He had collected lizards, snakes,
crickets, spiders, centipedes, moths, scorpions, bats, every
sort of noxious creature, and had studied their characteristics.
By a process of selection and exaggeration of their individual
truth, he had put together a monster, such as had never
existed, yet which might have been possible, deducing what
is not from what is with the precision of an Euclid or a
Pythagoras. The beast was issuing from its den in the rock;
grating its black and shining scales upon the gravel. Fetor
exhaled from its gaping jaws, smoke from its nostrils; its
eyes were flame. Horrible as was the monster, the wonder
of it lay less in its deformity than in its charm, which was no
less powerful than the charm of beauty.
</p><p>
Day and night Leonardo had studied and painted in the
stifling room empoisoned by the stench from the dead
reptiles; at last the picture was finished, and he summoned
his father to see it. He had placed it on a wooden stand
surrounded by black cloth, the light being so disposed that
only the monster was illuminated. Ser Piero came in, saw
the beast, and involuntarily drew back. Recovering himself,
he looked again, and his expression changed from great fear
to great pleasure.
</p><p>
'The <i>rotella</i> is ready,' said Leonardo; 'it produces the
effect at which I have aimed. You may take it away.'
</p><p>
Next he received an order for an 'Adoration of the
Magi' from the monks of San Donato a Scopeto. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
sketch for this picture he exhibited a knowledge of anatomy
and of the outward expression of the emotions, surpassing
that of any previous painter. Against a background almost
Hellenic in its beauty, he showed the Mother of God with
the divine Infant, who, smiling shyly, seemed to marvel at
the precious gifts brought by the strangers. They, wearied
and bowed down by the load of ancient and earthly wisdom,
bending their heads, shading their eyes, were absorbed in
contemplation of that miracle of miracles, the Epiphany of
God in man.
</p><p>
In his picture of the Fall, Leonardo had realised the
boldness of reason&mdash;the wisdom of the serpent; in this of
the Adoration he had shown the innocence of the dove, the
humility of faith. One picture the complement of the other;
the two exhibited the full circle of his philosophy.
</p><p>
But the second picture was never finished. In the quest
for perfection he made difficulties for himself which his
brush could not overcome. In the words of Petrarch, '<i>al
dissetamento era d'ostacolo l'eccessiva brama</i>'&mdash;'excessive thirst
hindered its own quenching.'
</p><p>
Meanwhile, Ser Piero married his third wife, Margherita,
who brought him two sons, Antonio and Giuliano. The
step-mother hated Leonardo, and accused her husband of
wasting the inheritance of his lawful children upon a bastard,
foster-child of a witch's goat. The young painter had
enemies also among his fellow-students; and it was one of
them who brought against him and against Verrocchio the
accusation of which Cesare da Sesto had told Giovanni
Boltraffio. The calumny had acquired some verisimilitude
from the exceptional friendship between master and scholar,
and from the fact that Leonardo, though the handsomest
man of young Florence&mdash;('in his exterior, says a contemporary,
there was such radiance of beauty that at sight of
him sad hearts were gladdened')&mdash;eschewed the society of
women. The accusation came to nothing, but he left
Verrocchio, and henceforth painted independently.
</p><p>
Reports now got about touching his heresies and atheism,
and it became increasingly difficult for him to remain in
Florence. Ser Piero introduced him to Lorenzo de' Medici;
uselessly, however, for <i>Il Magnifico</i> disapproved spirits too
daring and unconventional, and demanded a constant and
servile adulation which Leonardo was ill fitted to supply.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
The tedium of inaction oppressed him. He entered into
negotiations with the Egyptian ambassador for the purpose
of obtaining the post of chief architect to the 'diodario'
of Syria, though he knew that it would require his embracing
the Mahometan faith. His one desire was to escape from
Florence. Chance favoured him. He made a many-stringed
silver lute in the form of a horse's head, which took Lorenzo
de' Medici's fancy. Lorenzo sent it by the hand of the
inventor to Milan, as a gift to Ludovico Sforza.
</p><p>
Leonardo was received at the Lombard court not as a man
of science, not as a painter, but as the <i>sonatore di lira</i>&mdash;the
'player of the lyre.'
</p><p>
But before starting he had written a long letter to the duke,
setting forth how useful he might be to him.
</p><p>
'Most Illustrious Lord,&mdash;Having studied and estimated the
works of the present inventors of warlike engines, I have found
that in them there is nothing novel to distinguish them. I
therefore force myself to address your Excellency that I may
disclose to him the secrets of my art.
</p><p>
'1st. I have a method for bridges, very light and very strong;
easy of transport and incombustible.
</p><p>
'2nd. New means of destroying any fortress or castle (which
hath not foundations hewn of solid rock) without the employment
of bombards.
</p><p>
'3rd. Of making mines and passages, immediately and noiselessly,
under ditches and streams.
</p><p>
'4th. I have designed irresistible protected chariots for the
carrying of artillery against the enemy.
</p><p>
'5th. I can construct bombards, cannon, mortars, 'passavolanti':
all new and very beautiful.
</p><p>
'6th. Likewise battering rams, machines for the casting of
projectiles, and other astounding engines.
</p><p>
'7th. For sea-combats I have contrivances both offensive
and defensive; ships whose sides would repel stone and iron
balls, and explosives, unknown to any soul.
</p><p>
'8th. In days of peace, I should hope to satisfy your
Excellency in architecture, in the erection of public and
private buildings, in the construction of canals and aqueducts.
I am acquainted with the arts of sculpture and painting,
and can execute orders in marble, metal, clay, or in painting
with oil, as well as any artist. And I can undertake that
equestrian statue cast in bronze, which shall eternally glorify
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
the blessed memory of your lordship's father and of the
illustrious house of Sforza.
</p><p>
'And if any of the above seem extravagant or beyond the
reach of possibility, I offer myself prepared to make experiment
in your park; or in whatsoever place it may please your
Excellency to appoint; to whose gracious attention I most

</p><p>
When he caught his first glimpse of the snow-clad Alps
shining above the green plain of Lombardy, he felt himself
entering upon a new life, in a strange land which was to become
his true country.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>X</h3>

<p>Such was the half century of life upon which Leonardo
looked back as he ascended Monte Albano. The path had
become direct, vegetation was left below, the mountains
were bare, solitary, and terrible, as belonging to another
planet. He was blinded by fierce gusts of icy wind.
Stones breaking away from his feet fell noisily into the
ravine. He was still ascending, and at every step the prospect
widened. He found exhilaration in the effort of climbing,
gradually conquering the great mountains and compelling
them to give up their treasures. Florence was out of sight,
but the spacious district of Empoli was spread at his feet; first
the mountains, cold dull purple with broad shadows; then the
unnumbered billowy hills from Livorno to San Geminiano.
Everywhere was air, emptiness, space. The narrow footpath
seemed to vanish; he fancied himself flying over this
boundless expanse on gigantic wings. The realisation that
he had no such equipment produced in his mind the
wondering alarm felt by a man who is suddenly deprived of
his legs. He remembered how in boyhood he used to
watch the flight of cranes; and how, hearing their cry, he
had fancied it a summons to himself, and had wept for disappointment
that he could not obey. He remembered releasing
his grandfather's cage-birds, and joying in the wild swoops
of their recovered liberty. He remembered listening to the
tale of Icarus, who had thought to fly on waxen wings, but had
fallen and perished; and how, when bidden by his teacher
to name the greatest of ancient heroes, he had answered
without a moment's hesitation 'Icarus, son of Dædalus.' He
remembered, too, his pleasure in finding a clumsy representation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
of his hero among the bas-reliefs of Giotto's campanile
in Florence. He retained one other memory of his childhood
which, however absurd it might have seemed to another, had
for him a prophetic meaning. He wrote of it:&mdash;
</p><p>
'I remember that once in infancy, lying in my cradle, I
fancied that a kite flew to me and opened my lips, and
rubbed his feathers over them. It would seem to be my
destiny all my life to talk about wings.'
</p><p>
The question of human flight had indeed become the preoccupation
of his whole life. Now, even as forty years before,
standing again on the slope of the White Mountain it seemed
to him an intolerable injury, even an impossibility, that men
should remain wingless.
</p><p>
'He who knows all can do all,' thought Leonardo. 'I have
only to <i>know</i>; and there shall be wings.'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>On one of the final zigzags of the path he felt himself
touched from behind, and turning saw Giovanni Boltraffio
who, hat in hand, eyes half shut, head bent, was battling
with the wind, and had evidently been calling for some time
unheard. When he saw the Master with long hair streaming
on the blast, and look of indomitable will, his thoughtful
eyes, deep lines on his forehead, and overhanging brows
contracted in a frown, seemed to the disciple so strange
and terrible as to be barely recognisable. Even the broad
folds of his red cloak bellying in the wind were like the
pinions of some strange bird.
</p><p>
Giovanni shouted as loud as he could, but he was so much
out of breath he could only articulate broken phrases.
</p><p>
'Just come&mdash;from Florence. Letter&mdash;important&mdash;told to
give it into your hands at once!'
</p><p>
Leonardo guessed at a communication from Cæsar Borgia,
and quickly recognised the writing of Messer Agapito his
secretary.
</p><p>
'Go down at once,' said Leonardo, seeing Giovanni blue
with cold. 'I will follow you immediately.' And he watched
Boltraffio as he fought his way through the storm, clinging
to frail boughs of low-growing shrubs, crawling over rocks,
bending double, absurdly small and weak in comparison
with his surroundings and the fury of the elements. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
appeared an epitome of all human weakness; and, watching
him, Leonardo was reminded of the curse of some grave
impotence which seemed to have lain upon his whole life, which
had, he feared, condemned him to eternal sterility, besides
depriving him of the sympathy of his fellows.
</p><p>
'My Wings!' he thought, 'Ah! will not they fail like
everything else?'
</p><p>
And he remembered the words spoken by Astro in his
delirium, the answer of the Son of Man when the devil would
have seduced him by the terror of the abyss, by the fascination
of flight: 'Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God!'
</p><p>
He raised his head, set his teeth, and again addressed himself
to the ascent, conquering the mountain and the storm.
The path had disappeared. He guided himself over the
bare rocks where, perhaps, none had trodden before. Suddenly
he found himself upon the edge of a precipice, till now
unseen; misty dull purple filled with air and yawned beneath
his feet as if the void and endless heaven were below no less
than above. The wind had become a hurricane, and howled
and roared like continuous thunder. Leonardo could have
fancied that unseen evil birds&mdash;flock after flock&mdash;were sweeping
past him on gigantic wings. No further advance was
possible; never had the long familiar idea appealed to him
with such force; never had he been so impressed by the
logic, by the necessity, of the power of flight.
</p><p>
'<i>There shall be wings!</i>' he cried, 'if the accomplishment
be not for me, 'tis for some other. It shall be done. The
spirit cannot lie; and Man, who shall know all and who shall
have wings, shall indeed be as a god.'
</p><p>
And he pictured to himself the King of the Air, Him who
can pass all bounds and supersede all the laws which limit
human intelligence, the Son of Man coming in his glory and
power, the <i>Magno Cecero</i>, 'the Great Swan,' borne on wings
immense, white, shining as light itself, in the blue of heaven.
</p><p>
And his soul was filled with a joy akin to terror.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>As he descended from Monte Albano the sun was setting.
The pointed cypresses were black against the golden sky; the
receding mountains tender and translucent as amethyst. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
wind had subsided. He was approaching Anchiano, and the
hill town of Vinci was already in sight.
</p><p>
He stopped, and murmured:&mdash;
</p><p>
'From the mountain which takes its name from the conqueror
(Vinci&mdash;Vincere) Man shall take his first flight!'
</p><p>
And gazing at his birthplace, there at the foot of the White
Mountain, he repeated: 'Eternal glory to the nest from
whence he sprang!'
</p><p>
The letter from Messer Agapito announced the approaching
siege of Faenza, and demanded the immediate presence of the
new engineer and architect in Cæsar Borgia's camp.
</p><p>
Two days later Leonardo left Florence for Romagna.

<p>So ran Leonardo's new credentials.
</p><p>
These were the years in which Cæsar Borgia was gradually
recovering for Alexander <span class="smcap lowercase">VI</span>. the ancient States of the Church,
said to have been conferred on the papacy by Constantine
the Great. He had taken the town of Faenza from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
eighteen-year-old Astorre Manfredi; and Forlì from Caterina
Sforza. The lad and the woman had been confided to his
protection. He threw them both into the Castle of St.
Angelo. He concluded a fraudulent treaty with the Duke of
Urbino, and in 1502 planned a campaign against Bologna.
He was intent upon making himself sole and absolute ruler
of Italy. In September his enemies, including the dukes
of Perugia and Siena, as well as other important personages,
assembled at Mugione, and concluded a secret alliance
against him. Vitellozzo Vitelli swore the oath of Hannibal,
that within a year he would slay, imprison, or exile the
common foe. Report of this alliance having been bruited
abroad, it was joined by some of the greater princes.
Urbino rose in revolt; Cæsar's own troops mutinied; the
King of France was slow in coming to his help; he
seemed on the verge of ruin. Nevertheless he still had
resources, and his enemies were dilatory. The opportunity
was let slip, and presently these, his allied enemies, entered
into negotiations with the usurper. He overreached them,
contriving to set them at variance with each other; by profound
dissimulation and courteous manners converted them
to a more or less favourable attitude; and presently made
an urgent appointment to meet his foes in parley at the
newly-conquered town of Sinigaglia.
</p><p>
Leonardo had quickly become a prominent personage at
Cæsar's court. The duke employed him in adorning the
various towns with palaces, libraries, schools, barracks, and
canals. He constructed engines of war, made military maps,
and was present at all Cæsar's bloodiest exploits.
</p><p>
Leonardo did not wish to see too clearly, or to know
too accurately, what was taking place around him. He
eschewed politics. He confined himself almost entirely to
observations on physical and social phenomena: the manner
of planting orchards, the machinery for ringing the bells at
Siena Cathedral, the low music of the falling water in the
fountain of Rimini, the dove-cot in the Castle of Urbino.
He noted how the shepherds at the foot of the Apennines
placed their horns in the narrow openings of deep hollows,
so that echo should increase the volume of their sound. For
whole days he stood on the desolate shore of Piombino,
watching the falling of the waves; and while all around him
the laws of human justice were being broken, mused on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
the invariability of nature, and found deep-seated joy in the
eternal justice of the Prime Mover.
</p><p>
On a day in June the corpses of the young Astorre and his
brother were found in the Tiber, stones tied round their
necks. The crime was universally attributed to Cæsar. But
that day Leonardo noted&mdash;
</p><p>
'In Romagna four-wheeled carts are used, the front wheels
small, the back large: the construction is faulty, for all the
weight rests on the front.'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>II</h3>

<p>In the latter half of December 1503 the Duke of Valentinois,
with his whole court, moved from Cesena to Fano, on
the shores of the Adriatic, twenty miles from Sinigaglia,
where the meeting was appointed with his former enemies,
Oliverotto da Fermo, Vitellozzo Vitelli, and Gian Paolo
Baglioni. A few days later Leonardo came from Pesaro to
join his patron.
</p><p>
On the way he was overtaken by a storm. The mountains
were covered with impassable snow-drifts, the mules slipped
on the ice; great waves were heard breaking on the seashore
at the foot of the precipice. As darkness came on the
travellers lost the path, and, dropping the reins, they trusted
themselves to the instinct of their beasts. The mule
Leonardo was riding suddenly stopped and grew restive,
scenting the corpse of a man who had been hanged, which
still dangled from the branch of a solitary tree.
</p><p>
At last they saw a distant light, and the guide recognised
the inn at Novilara, a mountain town half way between
Pesaro and Fano. The travellers quickened their steps, and
presently were knocking at the massive entrance door,
studded with nails like the gate of a fortress. A sleepy
ostler came first; then the landlord, who declined to receive
the new arrivals. All his rooms, all his stables were overfilled;
there was not a bed in which three or four were not
sleeping&mdash;all persons of quality, soldiers and courtiers of the
duke's suite.
</p><p>
Leonardo told his name and exhibited his credentials,
sealed with the duke's seal. The host poured forth a torrent
of apology, and made offer of his own chamber, which at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
present contained only three French captains, all passably
drunk and sound asleep.
</p><p>
Leonardo entered the kitchen, which according to the
wont of the Romagna inns served also as a parlour. It
was very dirty, with patches of damp on the bare walls;
guinea-fowl were sleeping on their perches, and baby porkers
squeaking round the door; onions, gherkins, and sausages
were suspended from the ceiling. A whole pig was roasting
before the immense glowing fire. Guests crowded at long
tables, drinking and quarrelling over cards.
</p><p>
Leonardo sat down by the stove, and presently, at a
square board close by, he saw Baldassarre Scipioni, an old
man, formerly captain of the duke's Lancers; Alessandro
Spanocchia, the treasurer; Pandolfo Collenuccio, legate from
Ferrara, and a fourth gentleman, a stranger, who was gesticulating
forcibly, and crying in a thin squeaky voice:&mdash;
</p><p>
'I can prove this also, <i>Messeri</i>! I can prove this by
instances from ancient and from modern history! Call to
mind the states which have acquired military glory&mdash;Romans,
Spartans, Athenians, Ætolians, and the trans-Alpine hordes.
All the great commanders collected their armies from the
citizens of their own country. Ninus from the Assyrians,
Cyrus from the Persians, Alexander from the Macedonians.
I grant you that Pyrrhus and Hannibal won victories by
means of mercenaries, but these were generals of exceptional
genius. Nor must ye forget my main proposition&mdash;the very
corner-stone of military science&mdash;viz., that in infantry, and
infantry alone, lies the strength of an army. Not in cavalry,
not in fire-arms and powder, ridiculous toy inventions of
modern times.'
</p><p>
'You go too far, Messer Niccolò,' replied the captain of
lancers with a smile; 'fire-arms are becoming of some
importance. Whatever you say about the Romans and the
Spartans, I venture to think our troops are much better
equipped. A squadron of our French soldiers, or a battery
of thirty bombards, would have made short work of your
ancient Romans.'
</p><p>
'Sophisms! Sophisms!' retorted Messer Niccolò with
increasing excitement. 'I perceive in your words fearfully
perilous error! Some day the Italians will be taught, by a
rude lesson, the weakness of mercenary armies, and the
pitiful powerlessness of cavalry and artillery. Remember how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
the handfuls of Lucullus routed 150,000 horsemen, among
whom were cohorts of mounted men exactly similar to the
squadrons of the present French cavalry!'
</p><p>
Leonardo looked curiously at this man who spoke like an
eye-witness of the victories of Lucullus. The stranger wore
a long garment of dark red cloth, falling in straight folds;
it resembled that worn by the statesmen of the Florentine
Republic and the secretaries of the embassies. It was,
however, old and stained. The sleeves were threadbare,
and such linen as was to be seen was frayed and soiled.
The man had great bony hands, copiously dyed with
ink, and a wart on one finger. There was little dignity
in his air; he was lean and narrow shouldered, about forty
years of age, and with sharp irregular features. Sometimes
when he was speaking he would look over the head of his
interlocutor, as if peering into space like some long-sighted
rapacious bird. In his restless movements, in the feverish
flush of his swarthy cheeks, above all, in the intentness of
his large grey eyes, there was evidence of smouldering fire
within. The eyes themselves were malicious; yet at times, in
their sardonic smile, in their cold displeasure, there was an
expression of weakness almost pathetic.
</p><p>
Messer Niccolò continued to pour forth his notions; and
Leonardo marvelled at the strange mixture of truth and
error in his talk, at his audacity, and his slavish appeal
to the authority of the ancients. He approved him when
he spoke of the scientific difficulty in using guns of large
calibre, owing to the inaccuracy of their range; but the next
minute he asserted that fortresses were useless, because the
Spartans and the Romans built none. He appeared to regard
the opinions of the Greeks and Romans much as Leonardo
regarded mathematical axioms. The latter, however, did not
hear the conclusion of the dispute, as the landlord called him
to the bedchamber reserved for him upstairs.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>III</h3>

<p>It snowed all night, and in the morning the guide refused
to continue the journey, the weather being in his opinion not
fit even for a dog to go out in. Leonardo was forced to
remain at the inn. He amused himself trying a self-turning
roasting-spit which he had invented.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>

'With this mechanism,' he expounded to the astonished
onlookers, 'the cook need have no fear of burning the meat,
for the action of the fire remains even. With increase of
heat it turns faster, that is all.'
</p><p>
It would seem that the success of his flying-machine could
hardly have afforded him greater pleasure than the perfection
of this cooking engine.
</p><p>
In the same room Messer Niccolò was explaining to
certain young artillery sergeants an infallible system, based on
abstract mathematics, for winning at dice&mdash;'circumventing,'
as he called it, 'the caprices of the strumpet Fortune.' Every
time he tried to give a practical illustration of its value, he
lost, greatly to his own astonishment and to the amusement
of his audience. The conclusion of the game was unexpected
and not entirely to Messer Niccolò's glory. It revealed that
his pouch was empty, and that he could not meet his
losses.
</p><p>
Late that evening there arrived another guest, with a great
array of servants, pages, grooms, jesters, negroes, animals,
boxes, and chests. It was the elegant Venetian courtesan,
the <i>magnifica meretrice</i>, Lena Griffi, who had been so
nearly despoiled by Savonarola's 'youthful inquisitors.'
Two years ago, following the example of many of her sisterhood,
the repentant Magdalen had cut her hair and shut
herself up in a convent. This was, however, merely an artifice
to raise her price in the city tariff of courtesans, drawn up
for the use of strangers. From the monastic chrysalis she
had emerged like a butterfly awakened to a new and more
splendid life. Very soon the <i>mammola veneziana</i> had risen
to great celebrity, and had fashioned for herself, according
to the usage of the principal courtesans, a fine genealogical-tree,
by which it appeared that she was the daughter of
Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, brother of Ludovico, Duke of
Milan. She became the mistress of an old and doting
cardinal, whose infirmities were palliated by his wealth, and
was now journeying to Fano, where her elderly lover was
attached to Cæsar Borgia's camp. The host could not refuse
admission to so exalted a personage. He accommodated her
suite by turning out certain Ancona merchants from a fair-sized
bedroom, housing them in the forge, and promising
them a reduction in their bill. Similar treatment he proposed
for Messer Niccolò and his room-mates, the French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
captains, in order to provide a chamber for the lady
herself.
</p><p>
Messer Niccolò, however, protested, and grew very angry,
asking the landlord if he had lost his reason, if he knew with
whom he was speaking? if it were not unheard-of insolence
to insult respectable people for the pleasing of the first jade
tumbled in out of the street? Here intervened the hostess,
a masterful lady who, in the words of the proverb, had not
'pawned her tongue to a Jew'; she suggested that before
making so much noise he had better pay the bill for himself,
his servant, and his three horses; and also return the
four ducats lent him last Friday by her husband. And she
added, in a stage whisper, that she wished a bad Easter to
all the adventurers and beggars who swarmed on the high
roads, and, pretending to be great ones, lived at free quarters
and mocked at honest people. No doubt there was some
applicability in all this, for Messer Niccolò was reduced to
silence, and seemed considering how he could retire with the
best grace from his position. Meantime servants were
already removing his goods, and Madonna Lena's monkey
was grimacing at him, and jumping over the table among his
papers and great leather books, the <i>Decades</i> of Livy and
Plutarch's <i>Lives</i>.
</p><p>
Leonardo now approached and said, raising his berretto:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Messere, if it would please you to share my room, I shall
account it an honour, if your worship will permit me to render
so slight a service.'
</p><p>
Niccolò seemed astonished, and even confused; recovering
himself, however, he accepted the offer with suitable thanks.
Leonardo took him to his room, and assigned him the best
place. The more he looked at this strange man the more
attractive and interesting did he seem to him. He presently
learned his name: He was Machiavelli, secretary to the
Council of Ten in the Florentine Republic.
</p><p>
Three months earlier the astute and vigilant Signoria had
sent Machiavelli to make a treaty with Cæsar Borgia. The
latter had proposed a defensive alliance against their common
enemies, Bentivoglio, the Vitelli, and the Orsini; but the
Florentines, fearing the duke too much to desire either his
friendship or his enmity, had commanded their envoy to
meet his propositions merely with diplomatic and ambiguous
expressions of goodwill, and secretly to obtain free passage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
for their traders through the duke's territory along the shores
of the Adriatic, a matter of no small importance to their
commerce.
</p><p>
Leonardo also disclosed his name and rank; and soon he
and his new friend were conversing with that ease and mutual
confidence occasionally natural to persons of opposite
character, and habitually solitary and meditative.
</p><p>
'Messere,' burst out Niccolò, and his candour was not
unattractive, 'I know you by repute as a great painter; but
I warn you I have no knowledge of painting, nor am I even
fond of it. Of course you may respond, as did Dante to the
street mocker who offered him a fig, "I wouldn't change one of
mine for twenty of yours!" but I confess I am more interested
in having learnt from the duke that you are an expert in
military science. How important that is! Civil greatness is
founded upon war, and depends on the regular army. I am
writing a book on monarchies and republics, wherein I shall
discuss the natural laws which govern the life, growth, decline,
and death of every state, just like a mathematician discussing
the laws of number, or a natural philosopher physics.
Hitherto, sir, all who have written about the state&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
Here he stopped, and chid himself with a good-humoured
smile.
</p><p>
'Forgive me, Messere, I am taking a mean advantage. It
may be that policy interests you as little as painting interests
me?'
</p><p>
'Not so,' said Leonardo. 'I tell you candidly I don't
affect statecraft, because such talk is apt to be idle. But your
opinions are so new and surprising, that, believe me, I am
thrice happy to learn.'
</p><p>
'Beware, Messer Leonardo,' said the other; 'these matters
are my hobby-horse. I will go without bread, if I may but talk
upon politics with a man of understanding. The mischief is,
to find the man of understanding! Our great ones think of
naught but the price of wool and of silk, while I' (he smiled
bitterly) 'am made of neither.'
</p><p>
Leonardo reassured him, and added, in order to keep the
conversation going:&mdash;
</p><p>
'You have said, Messere, that politics should be an exact
science founded upon mathematics, like mechanics, which
finds its certainty in the observation and experience of nature.
Did I understand you aright?'
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>

'Perfectly!' cried Machiavelli, frowning, and looking into
space beyond his companion's head, with that air of a far-sighted
bird habitual to him. 'I desire to reveal a new thing
to men about human affairs. The Laws of nature, which are
outside man's will, outside good and evil, are the laws which
guide the life of every society. All former writers on this
subject have dealt with the good and the bad, the noble and
the base. I do not concern myself with governments which
ought to be, nor with what seems to be, but with that which
really is. I inquire into the nature of the great bodies, known
as republics and monarchies, and I commit myself neither to
praise nor to blame, like a mathematician or an anatomist.
I will tell men the truth, even if they burn me for it, as they
burned Fra Girolamo. For the task is dangerous.'
</p><p>
Leonardo smiled, observing Machiavelli's excitement, and
thought: 'With what passion he praises dispassionateness!'
</p><p>
'Messer Niccolò,' he said aloud, 'if you succeed according
to your intentions, you will have done more than Euclid or
Archimedes.'
</p><p>
Leonardo was struck by the unconventionality of what he
had heard. He remembered how, thirteen years earlier,
he had himself written on the margin of certain anatomical
sketches:&mdash;
</p><p>
'May the Most High assist me to study the nature of
human beings, their temperaments and habits, even as here I
have studied their internal organs!'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Suddenly Machiavelli exclaimed, his eyes sparkling merrily:
'The more I listen to you, Messer Leonardo, the more I am
astounded that we should have met. Some most rare combination
of the stars! The minds of men are, I protest, of
three qualities. First, those who see of themselves; secondly,
those who see when they are shown; thirdly, those who see
not of themselves, neither see when they are shown. Your
worship, and I myself (for I would not be guilty of false
modesty) belong to the first category. But you laugh? Ah!
such a meeting will not easily come to me again on this side
the grave, for on earth the elect are few. Permit me to read
you a most beautiful piece of Livy.'
</p><p>
He took a book from the table, adjusted the tallow candle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
put on iron spectacles (broken and tied up with string), the
large round glasses of which gave him a grave and devout
expression, as if he were addressing himself to some act of
worship. But no sooner had he found his passage, and
opened his lips, than the door opened, and a little wrinkled
old woman came in, curtseying and bowing.
</p><p>
'I crave your pardon, gentlemen, for this annoyance,' she
mumbled, 'but my illustrious lady, Madonna Lena Griffi, has
lost her favourite animal&mdash;a rabbit with a blue ribbon round
its neck. We have searched two hours for it, but vainly.'
</p><p>
'There are no rabbits here,' said Messer Niccolò, angrily;
'go to the devil!' And he was about to eject her, but
suddenly checked himself, and having looked at her narrowly,
both with and without his spectacles, he cried:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Monna Alvigia! Is it really you, you old witch? I
thought the devil had long ago roasted your old carcase!'
</p><p>
The woman blinked and cowered, answering his polite
greeting with a sorry smile.
</p><p>
'Oh, Messer Niccolò! how many years, how many winters
since we have seen each other! I had never expected God
would give us this pleasure again!'
</p><p>
Machiavelli invited the old woman to follow him to the
kitchen for a crack; but Leonardo, providing himself with a
book and seating himself in a corner, begged them to remain.
Then Messer Niccolò sent for wine with a lordly air, as if he
were the most honoured guest in the inn.
</p><p>
'Hark ye, friend,' he said to the servant who took his
order, 'bid that skinflint, your master, beware how he serve
us that acid stuff we had yesterday, for Monna Alvigia and
I are like Arlotto the priest, who would not kneel if the wine
were bad.'
</p><p>
Monna Alvigia forgot her rabbit and Niccolò his Livy; over
their pitcher of wine they gossiped like old friends. Alvigia
told tales of her youth when she had been fair to see and
much courted, and she had done what she wished and it had
not mattered what she did. Had she not once in Padua lifted
the mitre from the head of the bishop and placed it upon her
own? But years passed by, and her beauty faded, and her
lovers abandoned her, and she had to support herself by
hiring rooms and by taking in washing. Then she fell ill, and
she thought of sitting among the beggars at the church door,
and even of ending herself by poison. But the Holy Virgin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
came to her aid and rescued her from death. With the aid of
an old abbot, who was in love with the young wife of a blacksmith,
she entered upon a trade far more profitable than that
of a laundress.
</p><p>
The story was interrupted by a summons from Madonna
Lena, who required pomade for her monkey's wounded paw,
and Boccaccio's <i>Decameron</i>, which she always kept under her
pillow beside her prayer-book.
</p><p>
The old woman gone, Messer Niccolò mended a pen,
took paper, and began his report to the Magnificent Signori
of Florence, on the dispositions and actions of the Duke
of Valentinois, a piece of profound statesmanship, written in
easy, almost jocular style.
</p><p>
'Messere' he exclaimed, raising his eyes to Leonardo, 'confess
I surprised you by my sudden passage from discussion of
the virtue of ancient Sparta to vain gossip about women with
that old hag! Judge me not too harshly! We must imitate
nature. Are we not men? Is it not legended that Aristotle,
in the very presence of Alexander his pupil, permitted the
leman whom he loved to ride on his back while he caracoled
on all fours? Shall simple sinners be more discreet?'
</p><p>
By this time the household slept. All was silent save for
the chirp of the cricket, the muttering of Monna Alvigia, and
the growling of the monkey as she anointed its paw.
Leonardo had gone to bed, but lay watching his quaint
companion, who still gnawed his pen and stooped over his
writing. The candle flame threw on the wall a vast shadow
of his head with its sharp-cut angles, its protruding lower lip,
its thin neck and long beak-like nose. Having finished his
report he sealed it up, and wrote the words usual on
despatches: '<i>Cito, citissime, celerrime</i>.' Then he opened his
Livy and pursued his occupation of many years, the compiling
of notes for the <i>Decades</i>.
</p><p>
The shadow on the wall danced and wavered and grimaced
as the candle flickered and burned low; but the face of the
Florentine secretary preserved its stern and dignified calm;
the reflection of the greatness of ancient Rome. Only in the
depth of his eyes, in the corners of his lips there showed
sometimes a two-faced cunning, a mocking cynicism.</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Next day the storm was over. The sun sparkled on the
frozen windows; the snowy fields and hills, soft as down,
shone dazzlingly white under the azure sky. His companion
was no longer in the room when Leonardo awoke. He
dressed and descended to the kitchen where, to the joy of
the cook, a joint was roasting on the automatic spit.
</p><p>
He ordered his mule and sat down to breakfast. Beside
him was Messer Niccolò talking excitedly to a couple of newcomers.
One of these was a faultlessly fashionable youth
with an undistinguished face, a certain Messer Lucio,
related to Francesco Vettori. This Vettori was a man of
note in Florence, intimately connected with Piero Soderini
the <i>Gonfaloniere</i>, and very favourably disposed to Machiavelli.
He had sent Lucio with letters to Messer Niccolò
from his friends.
</p><p>
'Be not disquieted about the money,' Lucio was saying;
'my uncle assures me that last Thursday the Signori promised&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
'But, my dear sir,' interrupted Machiavelli, 'can two
servants and three horses be fed with promises? At Imola I
received sixty ducats and paid debts of seventy. If it were
not for the compassion of the benevolent, the secretary of the
Florentine Republic would starve. It is vain for the Signori
to talk of the honour of their town if they force the man whom
they send to a strange court to beg for his sheer necessities.'
</p><p>
Messer Niccolò knew these complaints were useless, but it
solaced him to make them. The kitchen being nearly empty,
he spoke without reserve.
</p><p>
'Here is our fellow-citizen, Messer Leonardo da Vinci&mdash;the
<i>Gonfaloniere</i> must know him,' resumed Machiavelli,
indicating the painter, to whom Lucio bowed courteously.
'Messer Leonardo was witness only last night of the
humiliations to which I am daily subjected. I demand&mdash;hear
you?&mdash;I do not ask, but I demand leave to resign my
office,' he concluded, his anger still waxing, and addressing the
young Florentine as if he saw in him the whole Magnificent
Signoria. 'I am a poor man, sir, and my affairs go from bad
to worse, and my health likewise. If matters continue as they
are I shall return home in my coffin. Moreover I have done
all which is possible to do, with the poor powers accorded me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
To drag out the negotiation, to go around and about, one step
forward and two steps back, "I will" and "I won't"&mdash;that is
not work for me! The duke is too clever for such childishness!
Well, I have written to your uncle&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
'My uncle,' interrupted Lucio, 'will doubtless do all he
can for you, Messer Niccolò; but the Magnificent Ten, to
tell truth, consider your reports so essential to the weal of
the republic that they will not permit you to retire. "Who
is there," they say, "able to take his place? He is a man of
gold; he is the ear and the eye of our commonwealth!" I
swear to you, Messere, that your letters have so great a success
in Florence that you could not desire a greater. All are
bewitched by the incomparable felicity of your style. My
uncle informed me that at a late meeting in the council
chamber, upon the reading of one of your merry letters, the
Signori burst themselves with laughter&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
'Oh, that's it, is it?' exclaimed Machiavelli, his face contorted
with rage. 'Ah, now I understand! My letters are
amusing to the Magnificent Signori; they burst themselves
with laughter, and they admire my diction. Thank God,
Niccolò Machiavelli is capable of something! Yet I live
here like a dog, I freeze and go hungry, I shake with fever,
and am insulted by landlords, all for the good of the
republic. The devil take the republic, and the <i>Gonfaloniere</i>
too, snivelling old woman! May you all be buried
unshriven and uncoffined!' And he burst into the vulgar
vituperation of the market-place, helplessly furious at the
thought of these chiefs of the people, so utterly despicable, and
yet his masters. To divert his thoughts Lucio handed him a
letter from his young wife, Marietta; a few lines written in a
round childish hand on coarse grey paper.
</p><p>
'<i>Carissimo Niccolò mio</i>,' so she wrote, 'I am told that in those
parts, where you are now, fevers and other sicknesses abound.
You may fancy my care for you. My thoughts give me no
peace day nor night. The boy, thank God, is well. He
grows apace, and is like you. His little face is white as the
snowdrift, but his head, with its thick black curls, is like
yours. He seems beautiful to me because he is like you.
He is lively and merry as though he were a year old. Believe
me, directly he was born he opened his eyes and he shouted
with a voice which filled the house. I pray you, forget us not.
I entreat, return to us at the earliest moment, for to wait
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
longer passeth my endurance. And, meanwhile, may the
Lord protect you, and the blessed Virgin! I send you two
shirts and two handkerchiefs and a towel. Your,</p>

<p class="right ph"><span class="smcap">Marietta</span> in Florence.</p>

<p>Leonardo observed that Machiavelli reading this letter
seemed another man. His face lit up with a tender smile
not to be expected on his harsh features. The smile, however,
quickly disappeared. He shrugged his shoulders, crumpled
the letter and stuffed it into his pouch, then said savagely&mdash;
</p><p>
'Who told her I was ill?'
</p><p>
'Messer Niccolò,' replied Lucio, 'every day Monna
Marietta has been to the members of the council asking for
you, and inquiring where you are and how you fare.'
</p><p>
'I know! I know! 'Twas like to be so. Affairs of state
should be reserved for celibates. One of the two&mdash;politics or
a wife&mdash;not both.' Then he turned abruptly and said, 'And
you yourself, good youth; you are perhaps thinking of
wedding?'
</p><p>
'Not at present, Messer Niccolò,' replied Lucio.
</p><p>
'Never commit that folly; unless you have the shoulders of
Atlas. Eh! Messer Leonardo?'
</p><p>
The painter understood that Messer Niccolò loved Marietta
passionately, but was ashamed to admit the fact.
</p><p>
The inn was now emptying fast; Leonardo prepared for his
start and invited Machiavelli to ride with him. But Messer
Niccolò shook his head, saying he must wait for money from
Florence before he could pay his bill. He spoke sadly, his
assumed levity having suddenly collapsed. He looked ill and
wretched. Inaction, long stay in one place was misery to him.
Not without cause had the Council of Ten complained of his
frequent, causeless, and unexpected removals, which were great
embarrassment to their affairs.
</p><p>
Leonardo took him aside and offered to lend the requisite
money. Machiavelli declined.
</p><p>
'You hurt me, my friend,' said the painter; 'remember
this rare conjunction of the stars! You would confer a benefit
upon me.'
</p><p>
There was so much kindness in Leonardo's voice that
Messer Niccolò had not the courage to persist in his refusal.
He took twenty ducats which he promised to return on receipt
of his money from Florence; then immediately paid his score,
with the lavishness of a great noble.</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>They started. The morning was calm and exquisite; the
air, still freezing in the shade, was in the sunshine almost
spring-like in its warmth. The deep blue-shadowed snow
crackled under the feet of the beasts. Between the white hills
shone the pale green of the winter sea, and yellow lateen sails
glanced here and there like poised butterflies.
</p><p>
Niccolò talked, jested, and laughed. Every trifle excited
him to some amusing or cynical reflection.
</p><p>
Passing a fishing village the travellers saw a group of fat
and jolly friars on the church steps selling rosaries to the
women, whose husbands and brothers stood aloof staring
stupidly.
</p><p>
'Fools!' shouted Messer Niccolò, 'know you not that fat
easily goes aflame; and that holy fathers like pretty women
not only to call them fathers but to make them so?'
</p><p>
Leonardo asked him what he had thought of Savonarola.
Niccolò replied that at one time he had been Fra Girolamo's
zealous partisan, hoping to find him the saviour of his
country; but too soon he had begun to see the weakness of
the prophet.
</p><p>
'The whole splenetic gang became nauseous to me,' he
mused. 'I detest even to think of it. The devil take them!'
he added energetically.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>About noon they rode in at the gates of Fano. The houses
were alive with Cæsar's courtiers, captains, and troopers.
Two rooms in the best situation had been assigned to the
ducal engineer; he offered one of them to his travelling
companion, who in such a crowd might have had difficulty in
procuring a lodging.
</p><p>
Machiavelli presented himself at once at the palace, and
when he returned he brought important news.
</p><p>
Don Ramiro de Lorqua, who had been governing in the
duke's name, had been executed. On Christmas day the
people had found the headless corpse wallowing on the ground
in a pool of blood, an axe beside it, the ghastly head stuck
on a spear.
</p><p>
'The cause of the execution is unknown,' said Messer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
Niccolò, 'but 'tis the talk of the whole town. Let us go together
and listen to the conjectures of the rabble. 'Tis
an opportunity to study the natural laws of politics.'
</p><p>
Before the old cathedral of San Fortunato a crowd was
expecting the coming forth of the duke, who was about to
review his troops. Leonardo and Machiavelli joined the
throng in which but one subject was being discussed.
</p><p>
'I can make nothing of it,' said a young workman with a
dull, good-natured face. 'I thought Don Ramiro had been
loved and enriched above all the court.'
</p><p>
'The very reason of his chastisement,' replied a respectable
shopkeeper, dressed in a squirrel pelisse; 'Don Ramiro has
been deceiving our duke. He has oppressed, imprisoned,
plundered the people. Before his lord he wore sheep's
clothing; he fancied things hid were not things forbid. But
his hour came; the sovereign's patience was exhausted, and
for the good of the people he did not spare his friend; he
cut off his head without trial, without hesitation, without
delay, as a warning to others. Now they see how terrible is
the duke's wrath, how impartial his justice. He puts down
the mighty from their seats and exalteth them of low
degree.'
</p><p>
'<i>Reges eos in virga ferrea</i>,' declaimed a monk. 'Thou
rulest them with a rod of iron.'
</p><p>
'Ay, ay! They need an iron rod, the sons of dogs, the
oppressors of the people!'
</p><p>
'He knows when to pardon, and when to strike.'
</p><p>
'We want no better sovereign.'
</p><p>
'Truly,' said a peasant, 'the Lord has at last had pity on
Romagna. Before, there was flaying both of the living and
of the dead and the taxes were our starvation. The last
pair of oxen in our stalls had to go! But since the Duke
Valentino came we have been able to breathe. May the
Lord keep him in health!'
</p><p>
'And the judges!' said the shopkeeper; 'their delay
used to eat one's very heart! 'Tis different now.'
</p><p>
'He has protected the orphan and consoled the widow,'
put in the monk.
</p><p>
'He is merciful. 'Tis not to be denied he is merciful to
the people.'
</p><p>
'He gives offence to none.'
</p><p>
'O Santo Iddio!' murmured a feeble old woman, beside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
herself with admiration; 'may the Blessed Virgin preserve to
us our father, our benefactor, our bright sun!'
</p><p>
'Do you hear them?' whispered Machiavelli. '<i>Vox populi
vox dei.</i> I have always said one must be in the plains to see
the mountains; one must be among the people to know the
sovereign. I'd like to get them here, those folk who call
the duke a tyrant! These things are hid from the wise and
prudent, but revealed unto the simple.'
</p><p>
Martial music was heard and the crowd was astir.
</p><p>
'He comes! Look!'
</p><p>
They stood on tiptoe and craned their necks, curious heads
were thrust from windows, women and girls, their eyes full of
love, ran out on the balconies and <i>loggie</i> to see their hero,
<i>Cesare bello e biondo</i>&mdash;'Cæsar, the blond and beautiful.' It
was rare good luck, for he hardly ever showed himself to the
people.
</p><p>
The musicians walked first, making a deafening clatter of
kettledrums in time with the heavy tread of the soldiers.
Next came the duke's Romagnole guard, all picked and
handsome men, carrying halberts three cubits long. They
wore cuirasses, and helmets of steel, and their garments were
parti-coloured, the right side yellow, the left red. Niccolò
could not admire enough this truly Roman array. After
the guard came equerries and pages, in clothes of unsurpassed
splendour; camisoles of gold brocade, mantles of
pounce velvet with gold-embroidered slashings, their scabbards
and belts of snakes' scales, with knobs representing the
seven heads of the viper vomiting poison&mdash;the cognisance of
the Borgias. Embroidered on their breasts was the word,
'Cæsar.' They were followed by the bodyguard, Albanian
<i>stradiotes</i>, with curved yataghans. Then Bartolomeo Capranica,
the <i>Maestro del Campo</i>, carried the naked sword of the
Gonfaloniere of the Roman Church. After him came the
ruler of Romagna himself, Cæsar Borgia, Duke of Valentinois.
He was mounted on a black Barbary stallion, with a diamond
sun on its headband: he wore a pale blue silk mantle with
the white lilies of France embroidered in pearls, and a corselet
wrought into the gaping mouth of a lion. His helmet was
a dragon, with scales, wings, and fins of wrought brass,
resounding at every movement.
</p><p>
At this time Cæsar Borgia was six and twenty; his face
had grown thin and worn since Leonardo had seen him at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>'s court at Milan. His features were sharper, and
his eyes, with their glow like polished steel, were graver and
more impenetrable. His hair and pointed beard had darkened;
his long nose seemed more aquiline. Complete serenity still
reigned upon his impassive face; only now there was a
look of still more strenuous daring, of terrifying keenness,
like the edge of a bared and sharpened sword.
</p><p>
The duke was followed by his artillery, the best in Italy.
Brass culverins, falconets, iron mortars firing stones&mdash;drawn
by oxen, their heavy chariots rolling along with a dull roar
and mixing with the voices of the trumpets and kettledrums.
In the glow of the setting sun, cannon, cuirasses, helmets,
spears, flashed lightning; Cæsar was riding in the imperial
purple of a conqueror, straight towards the immense blood-red
sun.
</p><p>
The crowd gazed at the hero in silence, holding its breath,
wishing, yet fearing, to greet him with applause, in an ecstasy
of admiration akin to terror. Tears flowed down the cheeks
of the old beggar woman, and she murmured:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Holy saints! Holy mother! The Lord has permitted
me to see his face! O, our beauteous sun!'
</p><p>
The flashing sword entrusted to Cæsar by the pope was the
fiery glaive of the archangel Michael himself.
</p><p>
Leonardo smiled, seeing on Machiavelli's face the very
same look of artless enthusiasm.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>On reaching home Leonardo found a letter from Messer
Agapito, bidding him wait on his Excellency the next day.
A little later, Lucio, who was passing through Fano on his
way to Ancona, came in for a visit, and Machiavelli spoke to
him of the execution of Don Ramiro de Lorqua.
</p><p>
'To divine the real reasons for the actions of a ruler like
Cæsar Borgia, is almost impossible,' he said, 'but as you ask
me what I think of this deed, I will tell you. Till its conquest
by the duke, Romagna was under the yoke of a number
of petty tyrants, and full of disorder, plundering and violence.
To end this state of turbulence Cæsar appointed his astute
and faithful servant, Don Ramiro, as his lieutenant. This
man accomplished his task; he inspired the people with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
salutary terror, and established perfect tranquillity throughout
the country, but he did it by a long series of cruel
punishments. When the prince saw that his object was
gained he determined to destroy the instrument of his
severity. Don Ramiro has been seized, on the ground of
extortion, and executed; his dead body lies exposed to
public view. This terrible spectacle has at once gratified and
awed the people. The duke's action has been wise, for he
has reaped three clear advantages. First, he has slain the
tyrants; secondly, by condemning Ramiro he has disassociated
himself from his lieutenant's ferocity and so has gained
a character for gentleness; thirdly, by sacrificing his favourite
servant he has set an example of incorruptible equity.'
</p><p>
Machiavelli spoke in a low dry voice, with expressionless
countenance, as if stating his reasoning on some theorem.
</p><p>
'From your own words, Messer Niccolò,' cried Lucio,
'I perceive that this supposed equity is the excess of
villainy!'
</p><p>
Sparks of fire appeared in the secretary's eyes, but he looked
away and spoke as coldly as before.
</p><p>
'It may be so,' he assented, 'but what of it?'
</p><p>
'What of it? Would you approve such scoundrelly statecraft?'
</p><p>
'Young man, you speak with the inexperience of youth.
In politics, the difference between the way men should and
the way they do act, is so great, that to forget it means to
expose yourself to certain ruin. For all men are by nature
evil and vicious; they are virtuous only for advantage or
through fear. A prince who would avoid ruin, must at all
hazards learn the art of appearing virtuous; and he must be
or not be virtuous as the case may require. He must disregard
all uneasiness of conscience as to those secret measures
without which the preservation of power is impossible; for
upon accurate knowledge of the nature of good and evil, it is
clear that the power of a prince will often be undermined by
his virtuous actions and augmented by his crimes.'
</p><p>
Lucio again protested. 'Reasoning thus,' he cried, 'anything
would be permissible, and there is no wickedness which
you could not justify!'
</p><p>
'That is so,' replied Machiavelli with perfect serenity, and,
as if insisting upon the significance of his words, he raised his
hand and added solemnly: 'All is permissible to the man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
who knows how to rule.' Then he resumed in his former dry
tone of ratiocination, 'Therefore, I conclude that the severity
of the Duke of Valentinois, who has put an end to pillage and
violence throughout Romagna, has been more rational and
no less merciful than the leniency of our Florentines, who
have permitted continued revolts and have fomented disorder
in all the provinces under their sway. For it is better to
strike down a few than bring a whole state to ruin as result
of its licence.'
</p><p>
'But,' said Lucio, somewhat overwhelmed, 'have there
been no rulers that were strangers to this cruelty? Think of
Antoninus and Marcus Aurelius.'
</p><p>
'Do not forget, Messere, that I am discussing the government
of conquered, not of hereditary principalities; and the
acquisition, not the maintenance, of authority. The emperors
you have named could afford clemency, because in the preceding
years there had been sufficiency of bloody deeds.
The founder of Rome slew his brother&mdash;a horrid crime&mdash;but
this fratricide was necessary to the establishment of a sole
authority, without which Rome would have perished from the
weakness consequent on domestic strife. Who shall be able
certainly to balance a single fratricide against all the virtue
and wisdom of the Eternal City? Doubtless we ought to
prefer the most humble fortune to greatness founded upon
evil deeds; but he who has once abandoned the path of abstract
righteousness, must, if he would not perish, walk resolutely
in the path of evil and follow it to the end: for men revenge
themselves only for small offences, great offences depriving
them of the power of revenge. Therefore, a prince must
inflict only serious injuries on his subjects, and must refrain
from minor injustices. Yet the generality persist in choosing
the middle course between wrong and right, which is
the most perilous. They recoil from crimes which demand
great courage, and commit only vulgar baseness which profits
them not.'
</p><p>
'Your words make my hair stand on end, Messer Niccolò,'
said Lucio, much shocked, but thinking a jest the most
courteous form of reply: 'You may speak the truth, but I
shall flatly refuse to believe these your real opinions.'
</p><p>
'Truths always seem improbable,' said Machiavelli dryly.
</p><p>
Leonardo, who was listening, had already observed that
Messer Niccolò, while pretending indifference, was casting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
sly glances at Lucio as if to gauge the effect his words were
producing. It was evident that Machiavelli had little self-command,
was not possessed of calm and conquering strength.
Unwilling to think like other men, hating the commonplace,
he had fallen into the opposite error, into exaggeration, into
the affectation of views rare and startling, but incomplete and
paradoxical. He played with such words as <i>virtue</i> and
<i>ferocity</i>, much as a juggler plays with naked swords. He had
a whole armoury of these polished, shining, tempting and
dangerous weapons, ready for the disabling of men like
Messer Lucio; men of the herd, respectable, sensible, conventional.
He punished them for their triumphant mediocrity,
and for his own disregarded superiority; he cut and scratched
them; but did not kill or even seriously wound them.
Leonardo remembered the monster which he had once
painted on the wooden 'rotello' for Ser Piero da Vinci; an
animal put together from the different parts of a variety of
repulsive reptiles. Had not Messer Niccolò put together as
useless and impossible a monstrosity in his superhumanly
astute and conscienceless prince? A being contrary to nature,
fascinating as Medusa, invented for the terrifying of the
vulgar? Yet under this wantonness of imagination, this
artistic dispassionateness, Leonardo perceived great suffering
in the soul of Messer Niccolò, as if a juggler, playing with
swords, were himself cut to the quick.
</p><p>
'Is he not one of those unhappy sick men,' thought the
painter, 'who seek relief from pain in envenoming their
wounds?' He did not know the last secret of this dark spirit,
so like, and yet so unlike, his own.
</p><p>
Messer Lucio, like a man in a nightmare, was struggling
with the Medusa head evoked by Messer Niccolò.
</p><p>
'Well, well!' he said, 'I will not dispute with you.
Severity may have been necessary to princes in the past.
We can pardon them a good deal for the sake of their
heroic virtues and exploits. But, pardon me, what has
this to do with the Duke of Romagna? <i>Quod licet Jovi
non licet bovi.</i> What is permitted to Alexander the Great or
to Julius Cæsar, may be unpardonable in Alexander the pope
or in Cæsar Borgia, of whom we cannot yet say whether he
be Cæsar or nothing. I at least think, and all will agree
with me&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
'Oh, of course, all will agree with you,' interrupted Niccolò,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
out of patience, 'but that is no proof, Messer Lucio. The
truth does not lie on the high road where all men pass. But
to conclude the discussion, here is my last word. As I
observe the acts of Cæsar, I find them perfect; and I would
suggest him as a model to all who would obtain power by
force of arms and by successful adventure. He combines
cruelty so well with virtue, he knows so accurately when to
caress and when to crush, the foundations of his power are so
firmly though so quickly laid, that already he is an autocrat,
the only one in Italy, perhaps the only one in Europe. It is
hard to imagine what may not lie before him in the future.'
Machiavelli's eyes burned, his voice shook, and red spots
glowed on his sunken cheeks; he seemed like a seer. From
the mask of a cynic looked out the face of the former
disciple of Savonarola, the fanatic.
</p><p>
But Lucio, weary of the discussion, had no sooner suggested
sealing a truce with two or three bottles from the
neighbouring cellar than the visionary disappeared.
</p><p>
'Nay,' cried Messer Niccolò eagerly, 'let us go to a different
tavern. I have a good scent in such matters, I know where
we shall find handsome women.'
</p><p>
'What, in this scurvy little town?' said Lucio.
</p><p>
'Listen, my lad,' said the dignified secretary of the
Florentine Republic, 'never you despise these same small
towns. In their vile alleys you can sometimes find what will
make you lick your fingers for delight.'
</p><p>
At these words Lucio slapped Messer Niccolò on the back,
and called him a sly dog.
</p><p>
'We will take lanterns,' continued Niccolò, 'we will wear
cloaks and vizards. On such expeditions mystery is half the
pleasure. Messer Leonardo, you accompany us?'
</p><p>
The artist excused himself.
</p><p>
He did not enjoy the customary gross talk about women,
and avoided it with instinctive repulsion. This man of
fifty, the intrepid student of the secrets of nature who could
accompany criminals to their execution that he might see
the last look of terror in their eyes, was often put out of
countenance by a jest, did not know which way to look, and
blushed like a schoolboy.
</p><p>
Niccolò, without more ado, carried off Messer Lucio.

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Early next day a chamberlain came to inquire whether the
ducal engineer were satisfied with his quarters, and to bring
him a present from Cæsar. According to the hospitable
custom of the time it consisted of provisions, a sack of flour,
a cask of wine, a sheep, a dozen fat capons; and also two
large torches, three packets of wax candles, and two boxes of
<i>confetti</i>. Impressed by these compliments, Machiavelli begged
Leonardo to say a word for him to the duke, and obtain him
the favour of an interview. At eleven in the evening, Cæsar's
customary reception-hour, they went together to the palace.
</p><p>
The duke's manner of life was strange enough. Summer
and winter he went to bed at four or five in the morning, so
that for him it was dawn at three in the afternoon, sunrise
at four; at five he began to dress and to dine and to
conduct his business affairs all simultaneously. He surrounded
his doings with mystery, not only out of natural secretiveness,
but by studied calculation; he seldom left his palace,
and always masked. Only on great festivals did he show
himself to the people, and to the troops only in moments of
extreme danger. He liked to astonish; his appearances were
always dramatic, like those of a demi-god.
</p><p>
Scarce credible reports were current as to his profuseness.
All the gold continually flowing into the treasury
of St. Peter's did not suffice for the expenditure of the
<i>Gonfaloniere</i> of the Church. Envoys reported that he spent
not less than eighteen hundred ducats daily; and that
when he rode through the streets crowds followed him to pick
up the easily dropped silver shoes, with which his horses were
shod, solely as largesse to the people. Wonders were told
also as to his physical strength. He could bend horse-shoes
in his fingers (thin and delicate as a woman's), twist iron
rods, break the cables of ships. At a bull-fight in Rome
some years ago, when he had been Cardinal of Valenza, the
youthful Cæsar had cut a bull in half with a single stroke of
his sword. Inaccessible to his courtiers and to the ambassadors
of great potentates, he was often to be seen on the hills
round Cesena watching the boxing matches of the wild
Romagna herdsmen, and sometimes taking part in the sport.
</p><p>
At the same time he was the ideal of a cavalier and the
paragon of fashion. On the day of his sister Lucrezia's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
marriage with Alfonso d'Este, he left the siege of a fortress
and rode from the camp to the wedding, unrecognised, and
clad in black velvet with a black mask. He passed through
the crowd of guests, bowed, and when all drew back in
surprise, danced to the strains of the music with such grace
that at once the cry was raised, '<i>Cesare! Cesare! L'unico
Cesare!</i>'
</p><p>
Heeding neither guests nor bridegroom, he drew Lucrezia
aside and whispered in her ear. Her eyes fell, she flushed,
then grew white, to the enhancement of her dainty pearl-like
beauty. It might be she was innocent; there was no question
that she was frail; report added submissive, perhaps even
criminally submissive, to the terrible will of this her brother.
</p><p>
He, it seemed, cared for one point only, that there should be
no proofs. Fame probably exaggerated his sins; but possibly
the reality was more terrible than fame. At any rate he knew
how to conceal his actions, and to wipe out every trace of
them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>X</h3>

<p>The old Gothic municipal palace of Fano served as the
duke's residence. Leonardo and Machiavelli crossed the
dreary hall where less important visitors were received, and
entered an inner apartment, once a chapel. There was
stained glass in the lancet windows; and the Apostles and
Fathers of the Church were carved in oak on the high stalls
of the choir. On the ceiling was a faded fresco of the Holy
Dove hovering over clouds and angels. The courtiers were
standing and talking in undertones, for the near presence of
the sovereign was felt even through the walls. The ill-starred
envoy from Rimini, a bald and feeble old man who had
been waiting three months for his audience of the duke,
clearly worn out by many sleepless nights, had fallen into a
doze. Now and then the door opened, and the secretary
Agapito, with an anxious air, spectacles on nose and pen
behind his ear, looked in, and summoned to his Highness
one or other of those waiting. Each time, the bald old
man from Rimini shuddered, started up, saw it was not his
turn, sighed heavily, and again sank into his doze. His
slumbers were soothed by the sound of an apothecary's pestle
beating in a mortar; for, a suitable room being lacking, this
chapel was used not only as the ante-chamber to the presence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
but also as the surgery. Where the altar had stood was a
table crowded with the bottles, gallipots, and retorts of a
physician's laboratory, and behind it Gaspare Torella, the
bishop of Santa Giusta, and the chief physician to the Duke of
Valentinois, was preparing a fashionable medicine, a decoction
of '<i>guaiaco</i>,' or, as it was commonly called, 'Holy tree,'
brought from the new islands discovered by Columbus. The
bishop-doctor, while he rubbed the yellow lumps in his shapely
hands, was discoursing on the nature of this healing tree; and
the oaken saints on the stalls seemed listening in amazement
to the strange talk of these new shepherds of the Lord's flock.
The chapel was lighted only by the physician's blinking lamp;
the air was choked by the pungent smell of the medicine,
mingled with faint perfume of the incense of earlier years;
one might have fancied this an assembly of prelates engaged
in the performance of some strange mystic rite. Meantime
the Florentine secretary was taking now one, now another of
the courtiers aside, and adroitly questioning them as to
Cæsar's policy. Presently he approached Leonardo and
whispered to him very mysteriously.
</p><p>
'I shall eat the artichoke; I shall eat the artichoke!'
</p><p>
'What artichoke?' asked the painter, bewildered.
</p><p>
'Precisely; what artichoke? It seems the duke propounded
a riddle to Messer Pandolfo Collenuccio, the Ambassador
from Ferrara. He said, "I shall eat the artichoke, leaf by
leaf." It may signify the league of his enemies whom he
means to separate, and so destroy one by one. I have
puzzled my brains over it for an hour.' Speaking still lower,
he continued, 'Here all is riddle and trap. They chatter
about every kind of nonsense, but directly you speak
of affairs they become dumb as monks at dinner. But
they shall not deceive me; I know very well there is something
in the air. I' faith, sir, I would sell my soul to know
what.'
</p><p>
And his eyes glowed like a desperate gamester's. Before
Leonardo could reply, he was summoned by Messer Agapito.
Through a long gloomy passage guarded by the Stradiotes,
Leonardo arrived at the duke's bedchamber, a spacious room
hung with tapestry and silk. On the ceiling were painted the
amours of Pasiphae and the bull. The bull, the heraldic
emblem of the Borgias, was repeated on all the ornaments of
the room, together with the triple tiara and the keys of St. Peter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
The room was warm and scented. A fire of juniper burned
on the marble hearth, and the lamp oil was perfumed with
violets. Cæsar, elegantly dressed, lay on a flat couch in the
middle of the room; he cared for two postures only, reclining,
or sitting on horseback. Apparently indifferent to everything,
he leaned his elbow on a pillow, listened to a report from a
secretary, and watched a game of chess which two of his
attendants were playing on a jasper table by his side. He
had the faculty of divided attention. With a slow, uniform,
mechanical movement he passed backwards and forwards
from one hand to the other a golden ball filled with scent,
which he carried as religiously as his Damascene dagger.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>He received Leonardo with a peculiar and charming
courtesy. Not permitting him to kneel, he held his hand and
made him sit in an armchair by his side. The duke wished to
consult him about plans tendered by Bramante for a new
monastery at the town of Imola, which was to be called Valentino,
and to have a superb chapel, a hospital, and a refuge for
pilgrims. By such munificent works of charity he wished to
erect a monument to his own Christian beneficence. After
Bramante's designs, he exhibited letters just cut for Girolamo
Soncino's new printing-press at Fano, being zealous in the
encouragement of the arts and sciences in his dominions.
Agapito then gave his master a collection of eulogistic odes
by Franceso Uberti the court poet; these Cæsar received
graciously, commanding a liberal reward for the author.
Then, as he insisted upon seeing satires no less than eulogies,
the secretary handed him a poem by Mancioni the Neapolitan,
who had been seized and confined in the Castle of St. Angelo
in Rome. This sonnet was full of savage abuse; in it Cæsar
was called a mule, the mongrel offspring of a harlot and a
pope, sitting on a throne, once Christ's now Satan's; a
circumcised Turk, a disfrocked cardinal, incestuous, apostate,
fratricidal.
</p><p>
'Why, O God, waitest Thou?' cried the poet; 'carest thou
not that Holy Church has become a stall for mules, a den of
orgies?'
</p><p>
'How does your Excellency wish the villain to be dealt
with?' asked Agapito.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
'Leave him till my return,' replied the duke quietly, 'I
will deal with him myself. I shall know how to teach these
scribblers manners!' he added, in a low voice.
</p><p>
Cæsar's method of teaching manners was not unknown.
For less serious affronts he had cut off hands, and seared
tongues with red hot irons. His report finished, the secretary
withdrew. Then audience was given to Valguglio, the astrologer,
who had drawn a new horoscope. The duke listened
attentively, for he was a believer in the influences of the
stars. Valguglio explained that Cæsar's late illness was due
to the entrance of Mars into the sign of the Scorpion; the
complaint would pass when Venus had reached her rising in
Taurus. Had the duke any matter of importance in hand, let
him choose for its date the afternoon of the 31st of December,
as the conjunction of stars that day was propitious; and
bending toward the duke's ear and raising his finger impressively,
the astrologer repeated thrice in a mysterious
whisper&mdash;
</p><p>
'<i>Fatilo</i>, <i>Fatilo</i>, <i>Fatilo</i>'&mdash;'Do it. Do it. Do it!'
</p><p>
Cæsar made no reply, but it seemed to Leonardo that
a shadow passed over his face. Then he dismissed the
seer and turned again to the <i>Ingegnere Ducale</i>.
</p><p>
Leonardo unfolded military plans and maps. Not merely
scientific, showing the nature of the soil, the direction of the
watersheds, the mountains, the windings of the rivers&mdash;they
were also artistic bird's-eye pictures of the localities, coloured
after Nature, and with every detail executed in perfection.
Squares, streets and towers of the towns could be recognised;
the spectator felt as if flying over the earth, and seeing at his
feet an infinite expanse. Cæsar examined with great attention
the topography of the district bounded on the south by the lake
of Bolsena, on the north by the Val d'Ema, on the east by
Arezzo and Perugia, on the west by Siena and the littoral.
This was the heart of Italy, Leonardo's home, the territory
of Florence, long coveted by the duke. Immersed in
thought, enjoying this fancied flight, Cæsar gazed long at
Leonardo's drawing, and felt as if he and the great inventor
were in such sort engaged in the same work. He raised his
eyes to the artist and cordially pressed his hand.
</p><p>
'I thank you, my Leonardo. Continue to serve me thus
and I shall know how to reward you. Are you comfortable
among us?' he continued solicitously; 'are you satisfied with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
your salary? Have you any request to make? You know
my pleasure in gratifying you.'
</p><p>
Leonardo, profiting by the opportunity, asked an audience
for Messer Niccolò. Cæsar shrugged his shoulders with a
good-humoured smile.
</p><p>
'He is a strange man, your Messer Niccolò. He demands
audience, and, when I receive him, talks about nothing at
all. Why did they send me such a mysterious person?'
Presently he asked Leonardo's opinion of the man.
</p><p>
'I find him, Excellence, one of the most astute and most
clear-sighted persons I have met in my whole life.'
</p><p>
'He is certainly intelligent,' said the duke, 'and I doubt
not he has understanding of affairs. And yet&mdash;he is unreliable.
He knows no mean in anything. However&mdash;I wish
him well, especially since he has your good word. He is
guileless, though he thinks himself the most cunning of men,
and would deceive me, whom he considers the enemy of your
Republic. I pardon him, understanding that he loves his
country better than his soul. Well, I will receive him; tell
him so. By the way, have I not heard he is compiling a book
on Statecraft and the Art of War?'
</p><p>
Cæsar laughed his low pleasant laugh, as if reminded of
something which had tickled him.
</p><p>
'Have you heard about the Macedonian phalanx? No?
Then listen. Once, Messer Niccolò explained from this very
book on war to my Master of the Camp, Bartolomeo
Capranica, and other captains, the laws of ranging troops after
the manner of the phalanx. He spoke with such eloquence
that all desired to see the phalanx in actual fact. We
went to a suitable field and Niccolò was to give orders.
Well, he wrestled with two thousand soldiers for nearly three
hours exposing them to the cold, the wind, the rain, but he
could not form his own phalanx. At last Bartolomeo lost
patience; he had never read a military book in his life, but
he took the troop in hand, and in the twinkling of an eye
he had drawn up the infantry in the desired order. There
we see the difference between practice and theory. But take
care how you allude to it! Messer Niccolò does not like to
be reminded of anything Macedonian!'
</p><p>
By this time it was three o'clock and the duke's supper
was brought, a dish of fruit, trout, and some white wine; like a
true Spaniard he ate and drank most sparingly. Leonardo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
was dismissed, but not before Cæsar had again thanked him
for the maps. Three pages carrying torches were detailed to
escort him to his lodging.
</p><p>
The painter told Machiavelli about his interview with the
duke. When he spoke of the maps of the Florentine territory
Messer Niccolò grew thoughtful.
</p><p>
'What? You? A citizen of our republic, for our bitterest
enemy? Do you know, sir, that for this you may be accused
of treason?'
</p><p>
'Really?' said Leonardo, astonished: 'I don't wish to
think so, Niccolò. I am no politician, but obey like a blind
man.'
</p><p>
Silently they looked into each other's eyes; and each recognised
the profound difference between them. The one might
be said to have no country: the other loved his country, in
Cæsar's phrase, 'above his own soul.'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>That night Niccolò went away, leaving no word as to the
Whither and the Why.
</p><p>
He returned next day, weary and frozen, entered Leonardo's
room, bolted the door, and announced that he wished to
speak on a matter of profoundest secrecy. Then he began a
narrative.
</p><p>
Three years ago, one winter evening, in a deserted corner
of Romagna between Cervia and Porto Cesenatico, a body of
cavalry was escorting Madonna Dorotea, wife of Battista
Caracciolo, captain of infantry in the service of the <i>Serenissima
Signoria</i> of Venice, and her cousin, Maria, a fifteen year old
novice in an Urbino convent, from Urbino to Venice.
Horsemen armed and masked fell on the party, seized the
ladies, put them on horses, and carried them off. From that
day they had not been heard of. The Council and Senate of
Venice, considering themselves outraged in the person of their
captain, appealed to Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>, to the King of Spain, and
to the pope, openly accusing the Duke of Romagna of the
abduction of Dorotea. However, they could not prove their
case, and Cæsar replied mockingly that, having no lack of
women, he had not occasion to steal them by highway robbery.
Reports began to be current, moreover, that Dorotea had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
quickly consoled herself, and that, having forgotten her
husband, she followed the duke in all his campaigns.
</p><p>
Maria, however, had a brother, Messer Dionigi, a young
captain in the service of Florence. When all the complaints
of the Florentine Signoria, before whom he had laid the matter,
proved as vain as the representations of the Venetians,
Dionigi determined to act on his own authority. He presented
himself before the duke under a feigned name, gained his
confidence, obtained admission to the dungeon of the Castle
of Cesena, found his sister, disguised her as a boy, and made
his escape with her. But at the Perugian frontier the
fugitives were overtaken, Dionigi was killed, and Maria haled
back to her prison.
</p><p>
Machiavelli, as Secretary of the Florentine Republic, was
interested in the event. He had been in Dionigi's confidence,
and had learned from him not only the plan of rescue, but
the accounts which the brother had acquired of his sister's
ill-fortune, and of her reputation as a miracle-working saint,
bearing the 'stigmata' like St. Catharine of Siena.
</p><p>
Cæsar, tired of Dorotea, had cast his eyes on Maria,
and having never experienced difficulty with women, not
even with the most discreet, counted on an easy conquest.
He was mistaken. The girl met him with a resistance
which he could not overcome. Report said that of late the
duke had constantly visited her in her cell, staying for long
periods alone with her. But what passed at these interviews
no one knew.
</p><p>
Machiavelli ended his recital with expression of a fixed
determination to rescue Maria.
</p><p>
'If you, Messer Leonardo, will consent to help me, I will
so arrange the matter that none shall know of your share in
it. First I shall require of you information as to the internal
construction and arrangement of the Castle of San Michele,
where Maria is kept in durance. You, as the court engineer,
will find it easy to obtain entrance and to discover all we
need to know.'
</p><p>
Leonardo for all reply gazed at his friend in amazement,
and presently Messer Niccolò broke into a forced and somewhat
angry laugh.
</p><p>
'I hope,' he said, 'you do not honour me by thinking
me over sentimental, too chivalrously generous? Whether
Cæsar seduce this minx or no is nothing to me. Would you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
know why I concern myself in the affair? First, to show the
illustrious Signoria that I am good for something besides
foolery; but secondly and chiefly, because I require amusement.
If a man commit no follies he loses his wits
through weariness. I am sick of chattering, playing dice,
going to bawdy houses, and making vain reports to the
Florentine Wool-staplers. So I have devised this adventure:
action I assure you, not mere talk. The opportunity must
not be wasted. My whole plan is ready and I have taken all
necessary precautions.'
</p><p>
He spoke hurriedly as if excusing himself. Leonardo, however,
understood that he was ashamed of genuine kind-heartedness,
and was trying to conceal it under a mask of
cynicism.
</p><p>
'Messere,' said the artist, 'I pray you to rely on me in this
matter as on yourself. But on one condition, that if we fail,
I shall share your responsibility.'
</p><p>
Niccolò, visibly touched, clasped his hand, and at once set
forth his design. Leonardo made no criticism, though in his
heart he doubted whether it would prove practical. The
liberation of the captive was fixed for the 30th of December.
</p><p>
Two days before the date agreed upon, one of Maria's
gaolers, who was in Niccolò's pay, came running to inform
him that Cæsar knew all. Machiavelli being absent,
Leonardo went in search of him to give him this news. He
found the Florentine Secretary in a tavern, where a troop of
gamesters, chiefly Spanish soldiers, were fleecing inexpert
players at dice or cards. Surrounded by a merry group of
young libertines, Machiavelli was expounding that famous
sonnet of Petrarch's on Laura, which ends:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">'E lei vid' io ferita in mezzo 'l core'</p>

<p>and discovering some obscene allusion in every line, while his
hearers were convulsed with laughter.
</p><p>
Suddenly an uproar arose in the next room; women
screamed, tables were overthrown, swords clashed, coins and
broken bottles were dashed against the walls and floor. One
of the players had been detected cheating. Niccolò's
audience ran to join the fray, and Leonardo whispered his
news to his friend, and led him home.
</p><p>
It was a still, star-lit night. New fallen snow creaked
under their feet; the fragrance of the air was delicious after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
the stifling tavern. When Messer Niccolò heard that their
plot for the rescue of the girl Maria had come to the
knowledge of the duke, he replied coolly that for the moment
there was no occasion for alarm. Then he continued with
voluble apology.
</p><p>
'You were surprised to find me acting cheap jack to that
Spanish rabble? What of it? 'Tis law of necessity.
Necessity jumps, Necessity dances, Necessity trolls catches.
They may be rascals, but they are more generous than the
magnificent Signoria of Florence.'
</p><p>
There was so much bitterness and self-accusation in his
tone that Leonardo could not bear it.
</p><p>
'You are wrong, Messer Niccolò,' he said, 'to speak thus
with me. I am your friend and shall not judge like the vulgar.'
</p><p>
Machiavelli turned away&mdash;and answered in a low voice,
'I know it&mdash;judge me not harshly, Leonardo. Often I jest
and laugh lest my heart's grief should set me weeping. Such
is my lot! I was born under a luckless star. While my
fellows, men of no intelligence, succeed in everything, live in
honour and luxury, acquire power and wealth, I remain
behind them all, out-jostled by fools. They think me a buffoon,
perchance they be right. Yet I fear neither great labours
nor certain perils; but what I cannot suffer is that my life
should be consumed in the pitiful effort to make two ends
meet, to tremble over every groat, to endure paltry affronts daily
from my inferiors! 'Tis an accursed life! If God do not come
to my aid, I shall end by abandoning my work, my Marietta,
and my son. What am I but a burden to them and to all?
Let them think what they will: let them imagine me dead.
I will hide me in some distant hamlet, some corner of the
earth where none shall know me; where I shall be clerk to
the <i>podestà</i>, or teacher of the alphabet in a village school, that
I may not die of starvation so long as I retain my senses.
My friend, there is naught more terrible than to feel in yourself
the power to do something, and to know that you will
perish and die without ever having accomplished anything
whatsoever.'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>As the day for the adventure approached, Leonardo perceived
that Machiavelli, notwithstanding his anticipations
of success, was losing his coolness, and becoming inclined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
either to undue caution or to over precipitancy. The artist
knew well this state of mind: the result, not of cowardice
nor of pusillanimity, but of that treachery of the will, that
fatal irresolution when the moment for striking has arrived,
which is inherent in men made for contemplation rather than
for action.
</p><p>
On the eve of the eventful day Niccolò went to a little place
near the Torre di San Michele, to make the final preparations.
Leonardo was to join him early in the morning. Left alone,
the latter momentarily expected disastrous news; he felt
very little doubt that the affair would end in some stupid
failure, on a par with the prank of a schoolboy.
</p><p>
The dull winter morning was dawning, and he was about
to make his start when Niccolò returned. Pale and woe-begone,
he sank half-fainting on a chair.
</p><p>
''Tis at an end,' he said shortly.
</p><p>
'I expected as much!' cried Leonardo. 'I guessed we
should fail.'
</p><p>
'We have not failed, but we are too late; the bird has
flown.'
</p><p>
'How has she flown?'
</p><p>
'This morning, before the dawn, Maria was found on the
prison floor with her throat cut.'
</p><p>
'And the murderer is&mdash;&mdash;?'
</p><p>
'The murderer is unknown, but it is not the duke. Cæsar
and his executioners are no bunglers, and this poor child has
been hacked&mdash;&mdash;They say she has died a maid. My
notion is that she herself&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
'Impossible! She would not have done it. She was
a saint&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
'Anything is possible. You don't know this crew yet.
And that infamous assassin&mdash;I tell you that infamous assassin
is capable of anything! He could force even a saint to lay
hands on herself! Ah! I saw her twice in the beginning of
her martyrdom, when she was not so closely watched. She
was fragile, with an innocent face like a child's. Her hair
was thin and of pale gold, like Lippo Lippi's Madonna in
the Badia. There was no special beauty about her. Oh, Messer
Leonardo, you cannot know what a sweet, helpless child she
was!'
</p><p>
He turned away, tears glistening on his eyelashes. But he
continued in a sharp, forced voice:&mdash;
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>

'I have always said it! An honourable man in this court
is like a fish in a frying-pan. I have had enough of it! I
was not made to be a slave. The Signoria must transfer me.
I won't stay here.'
</p><p>
Leonardo was sincerely grieved for Maria, and he would
have done his utmost on her behalf. Nevertheless it was a
relief both to him and to Messer Niccolò that there was no
longer any demand upon them for decisive action.</p>

<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>The larger part of Cæsar's army marched out of Fano at
dawn on the 30th of December, and encamped outside Sinigaglia.
Next day (the date recommended by the astrologer),
the duke himself was to arrive. Sinigaglia had been besieged
by the confederates of Mugione, who had come to terms with
Cæsar, and were now acting for him. The town had surrendered,
but the commandant of the castle swore he would
open his gates only to Cæsar in person. Accordingly the
duke had sent word that he was coming, and he had invited
the repentant confederates to meet him on the banks of the
Metauro, where his camp lay, that they might hold a council
of war. These men, his former enemies, now his allies, had
perhaps a presentiment of evil, and would have declined to
meet him. However, he reassured them, 'bewitching them,'
as Machiavelli afterwards wrote, 'like the basilisk which
entices its victims by the sweetness of its singing.'
</p><p>
Machiavelli left Fano with the duke. Leonardo followed
alone some hours later.
</p><p>
The road led southwards along the seashore. On the right,
mountains descended sheer to the sea, scarcely allowing room
for the narrow road at their base. It was a grey day, very
still; the water was grey and unruffled as the sky. The
drowsy air, the chirping of the birds, black spots and holes in
the surface of the snow, all portended a thaw.
</p><p>
At last the brick towers of Sinigaglia came in sight; the
town lay like a trap between the mountains and the sea, not
a mile from the Adriatic, not a cross-bow shot from the foot
of the Apennines. Upon meeting the stream of the Misa,
the road turned sharply to the left; here was a bridge slanting
across the little river, and behind it the gates of the town
frowned across a square with low buildings, chiefly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
storehouses belonging to Venetian merchants. At that time Sinigaglia
was a large semi-Oriental bazaar, where Italian traders
exchanged their wares with Turks, Armenians, Greeks,
Persians, and Slavs from Montenegro and Albania. At
this moment, however, even the busiest streets were empty.
Leonardo met only soldiers. Here and there in the long
arcades, which extended monotonously along each side of
the street, in the shops, the warehouses, the <i>fondachi</i>, he saw
traces of plunder&mdash;broken glass, forced locks, severed bolts
and bars, doors thrown open, and wares and bales ruthlessly
exposed. There was a smell of fire, and some half-consumed
houses were still smoking; corpses hung from the iron lamp-stanchions
at the corners of the palace.
</p><p>
It was growing dark when, in the principal piazza near the
palace, Leonardo saw Cæsar Borgia surrounded by his guards.
He was punishing the soldiers who had pillaged the town.
Messer Agapito was in the act of reading their sentences;
then at a sign from the duke the condemned were conducted
to the gallows. At this moment Leonardo was joined by
Machiavelli.
</p><p>
'What do you think of it?' asked Messer Niccolò eagerly,
'if indeed you have heard&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
'I have heard nothing, and am glad to meet you. Pray
tell me.'
</p><p>
Machiavelli took him into the next street, then through
several narrow lanes, choked with snow, to a deserted district
by the shore. Here in a lonely tumble-down hovel, belonging
to the widow of a shipbuilder, he had succeeded in finding
the only vacant quarters in the town, two diminutive rooms for
himself and his friend. He lit a candle, drew a bottle of
wine from his pocket, broke its neck against the wall, and
seated himself opposite Leonardo, gazing at him with glowing
eyes.
</p><p>
'You have not heard?' he said gravely. 'A rare and
memorable thing has been done. Cæsar has revenged
himself on his enemies. The conspirators have been seized;
Oliverotto, Orsini, and Vitelli are awaiting sentence of death.'
He threw himself back in his chair, watching Leonardo, and
enjoying his astonishment. Then making an effort to appear
calm and dispassionate, he told the story of the trap of
Sinigaglia.
</p><p>
Arrived early at the camp on the Metauro, Cæsar sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
forward two hundred horsemen, set the infantry in motion,
and followed them himself with the rest of the cavalry.
He knew that the allied generals would come to meet him,
and that their forces had been distributed in the forts
surrounding the town, so as to make room for the new
troops. Outside the gates where the road curved, following
the bank of the Misa, he drew up his cavalry in two lines,
leaving space between them for the passage of the infantry,
which, without a halt, crossed the bridge and entered the
gates of the town.
</p><p>
The allies, Orsini, Gravina, and Vitellozzo, rode out to
meet the duke, escorted by a few horsemen. As if presaging
disaster, Vitellozzo was so gloomy and abstracted that those
about him who knew his customary phlegm were astounded;
it was known that he had taken leave of his family as if going
to his death. The generals dismounted from their mules
and saluted the duke. He also left his horse, gave his hand
to each, and then embraced and kissed them, calling them
his 'beloved brothers,' with many demonstrations of courtesy.
According to a preconcerted arrangement, Cæsar's captains
surrounded the generals in such a way that each was the
centre of a group of Borgia's adherents; meantime the
duke, observing the absence of Oliverotto, signed to Don
Michele Corella, his captain, who rode off, and having found
Oliverotto with his troops, made a pretext for bringing him
also to Cæsar's presence. Then, conversing amicably on
military matters and future tactics, they went all together to
the palace, which stood just in front of the fortress.
</p><p>
At the entrance the generals would have taken their leave,
but the duke, with the same urbanity as before, invited them
into the palace.
</p><p>
Scarcely had they set foot in the first chamber, when the
doors were secured, armed men rushed on the four generals,
seized, disarmed, and bound them. Such was their astonishment
that they scarce offered any resistance. The duke
intended to disembarrass himself of his victims that very
night by strangling them in a secluded part of the palace.
</p><p>
'Truly, Messer Leonardo,' cried Machiavelli, 'I would you
had seen how he embraced them and kissed them! One
mistrustful glance, one suspicious gesture might have betrayed
him; but there was such sincerity in his voice, on his countenance,
that till the final moment I guessed naught, nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
could have believed he was acting a part. Of all stratagems
since politics began, this must be the finest!'
</p><p>
Leonardo smiled. 'Doubtless,' he said, 'his Excellency
has exhibited audacity and craft; but I comprehend not what
in this betrayal so moves your admiration.'
</p><p>
'Betrayal? Nay, sir, when it is a question of saving your
country, there can be no question of betrayal or of loyalty, of
good or evil, of clemency or cruelty. All means are alike,
provided the object is gained.'
</p><p>
'Is this a question of saving his country? Methinks the
duke has studied but his own advantage.'
</p><p>
'Can it be that even you do not understand? Cæsar is the
future autocrat of an united Italy. Never was a time more
favourable for the advent of a hero. If Israel had to serve in
bondage in order that Moses should arise; if the Persians
had to lie under the yoke of the Medes that Cyrus might be
exalted; if the Athenians had to waste themselves in internecine
strife that Theseus might have eternal glory, then
it is necessary also, in this our own day, that Italy be
shamed, and enslaved, bound, and divided, without a head,
without a leader, without a guide; devastated, trampled
on, crushed by all the woes which a nation can endure, in
order that a new hero shall rise to be the saviour of his
land. Many times men have appeared whom she has fancied
the destined one, and have died leaving the great deed
undone. Half-dead, scarce breathing, she still awaits her
deliverer, who shall heal her wounds, put an end to disorder
in Lombardy, plunder in Tuscany, extortion and murder in
Naples. Day and night Italy cries to her God, if, perchance,
He will send her a saviour!'
</p><p>
His voice rang like a chord too tightly stretched, and
broke. He was white and shaking, and his eyes glowed. In
his excitement was something convulsive, powerless, akin to
epilepsy.
</p><p>
Leonardo remembered how, speaking of Maria's suicide, he
had called the Duke of Valentinois a monster of crime. He
did not point out the inconsistency, knowing that Messer
Niccolò, in his exaltation, would repudiate his softer mood.
</p><p>
'Who lives long, sees much, <i>Niccolò mio</i>. But permit me
one question. Why is it <i>to-day</i> that you have assured yourself
of Cæsar's divine election? Has the <i>inganno di
Sinigaglia</i> proved his heroism?'
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>

'Yes,' replied Machiavelli, recovering his impartial air;
'the violence of his action has shown that he has the rare
combination of great qualities and their opposites. I do
not blame. I do not praise. I simply examine. Here is
my reasoning on the matter: there are two ways open to
him who would arrive at a particular end. The first is
law, the second violence. The first belongs to men&mdash;the
second to beasts. He who wishes to rule must tread both
ways, must know how to be either beast or man. Such
is the inner meaning of the old legends of Achilles and
other heroes nurtured by Chiron, the centaur, half-god, half-beast.
The major part of men cannot support the weight of
liberty, and fear it more than death. When they have committed
a crime they are crushed under the burden of
repentance. 'Tis only the hero, the man of destiny, who
has the strength to support liberty, who breaks laws without
fear, without remorse, who remains innocent even in evil, as
do beasts and gods. To-day, for the first time, I have seen
in Cæsar the infallible sign that he is elect of God!'
</p><p>
'Yes, yes, I understand,' said Leonardo moodily; 'but to
my thinking that man is not free who, like Cæsar, dares all
because he knows naught and loves naught. <i>I call him free
who dares all because he knows all and loves all.</i> That is the
liberty whereby men shall conquer both good and evil, the
height and the abyss, the bounds of earth, its obstacles and
burdens; shall become as gods, and fly.'
</p><p>
'Fly?' said Machiavelli bewildered.
</p><p>
'When they have perfect knowledge they will make themselves
wings. 'Tis a subject upon which I have thought
much. Perhaps nothing will come of it. I care not; if it be
not I, 'twill be another. The day will come when there
shall be wings.'
</p><p>
'Well, let us congratulate each other. Our talk has led us
to a new creation. My prince is to be half-god, half-beast;
and you have given him wings.'
</p><p>
But the striking of a clock in the neighbouring tower
drove Messer Niccolò forth; he had to hasten to the palace
that he might learn of the impending execution of the
generals.
</p><p>
Isabella Gonzaga, Marchesa of Mantua, by way of congratulation,
sent Cesare a carnival gift of a hundred pretty
masks in coloured silk.
</p><p>

<h3>XV</h3>

<p>Cæsar returned to Rome in the beginning of March 1503.
The Pope proposed to reward the hero with the Golden
Rose, the highest distinction which the Church could confer
on her champions. The cardinals assented, and two days
later the ceremony of investiture took place. The Roman
Curia and the envoys of the great powers assembled in the
Sala de' Pontefici, which looks out on the Cortile del Belvedere.
Alexander <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span>, seventy years of age and corpulent, but still
vigorous and majestic, ascended the dais, wearing the
begemmed mantle and triple crown, the ostrich fans waving
over his head.
</p><p>
Trumpets blared, and at a signal from Johann Burckhardt,
Master of Ceremonies, the armour-bearers, pages, couriers,
and guards of the Duke of Romagna, entered the hall,
accompanied by Bartolomeo Capranica, his Master of the
Camp, bearing the naked sword of the <i>Gonfaloniere</i> of the
Roman Church. The sword was gilded and damascened
with delicate designs. First, the Goddess of Fidelity seated
on a throne, with the legend, 'Fidelity is stronger than Arms.'
Secondly, Julius Cæsar in his triumphal car, with the legend,
'<i>Aut Cæsar aut Nihil</i>.' Thirdly, the passage of the Rubicon
with the legend, 'The die is cast.' Lastly, a sacrifice to the
Bull of the House of Borgia&mdash;naked priestesses burning
incense over a human victim, and on the altar the inscription
'<i>Deo optimo maximo Hostia</i>,' and lower, '<i>In nomine Cæsaris
omen</i>.' The human sacrifice to the beast acquired a more
terrible meaning from the fact that these engravings and
mottos had been ordered at the moment when Cæsar was
contemplating the murder of his brother Giovanni, in order to
take from him this sword of the standard-bearer of the Church.
</p><p>
Following the insignia of his office came the hero himself,
crowned with the lofty ducal <i>berretto</i>, embroidered in pearls
with the Holy Dove. He approached the Pope, removed
the <i>berretto</i>, knelt and kissed the ruby cross on the shoe of
the Pontifex Maximus. Cardinal Monreale handed the
Golden Rose to His Holiness. It was a marvel of the
jeweller's art; from a phial concealed under the gold filigree
petals exhaled the perfume of innumerable roses. The Pope
stood, and in a voice quivering with emotion uttered the
words:&mdash;
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>

'Receive, most beloved son, this rose, symbol of the joy
of the two Jerusalems, earthly and heavenly, of the two
churches, militant and triumphant; the incorruptible flower,
the delight of the saints, the beauty of imperishable crowns.
May thy virtue flower in Christ as this rose, which blossoms
on the shore of many waters! Amen.'
</p><p>
Cæsar received the mystic rose from the paternal hands.
</p><p>
It was more than the old man could bear. To the disgust
of Burckhardt, the stolid German master of the ceremonies,
he broke through the prescribed ceremonial; bending over
his son he stretched out his trembling hands, his face contracting
and his shoulders shaking as he murmured:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Cesare! Cesare! <i>figlio mio!</i>'
</p><p>
The duke handed the rose to the Cardinal di San Clemente,
and the Pope embraced him in a frenzy of joy, laughing and
weeping.
</p><p>
Again the trumpets blared, the great bell of St. Peter's
pealed, and was answered by the bells of all the churches in
the city, and by salvos of artillery from the Castle of St.
Angelo. In the Cortile del Belvedere the Romagnole guard
shouted:&mdash;
</p><p>
'<i>Viva Cesare!</i> <i>Viva Cesare!</i>'
</p><p>
And the duke came out on the balcony to greet his troops.
Under the blue sky, in the brilliance of the morning sun,
his vesture gold and purple, the Dove of the Holy Spirit on
his head, the mystic rose in his hand, to the people he
was not a man, but a god.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>That night there was a splendid masked procession; the
triumph of Julius Cæsar as it was shown on the sword of
the Duke of Valentinois and Romagna. He himself took
his seat in the chariot bearing the inscription 'Cæsar the
divine'; his head was crowned with laurel, and he carried
a palm-branch in his hand. The chariot was surrounded by
his soldiers, dressed as Roman legionaries, with eagles and
javelins. All was correctly ordered in accordance with
descriptions on books and representations in monuments
and medals.
</p><p>
Before the chariot walked a man in the long white robe
of an Egyptian hierophant, carrying a banner with the Borgia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
Bull, purple and gilded; the bloody Apis, protecting god of
Alexander <span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span> Boys in cloth of silver sang to the clashing
of timbrels:&mdash;
</p><p>
'<i>Vive diu Bos!</i> <i>Vive diu Bos!</i> <i>Borgia vive!</i>' Glory to
the Bull! Glory to the Bull! Glory to Borgia!' And high
above the crowd, lighted by the flare of torches, swung the
image of the beast, fiery as the rising sun.
</p><p>
In the crowd was Leonardo's pupil, Giovanni Boltraffio,
who had newly arrived from Florence. Looking at the
purple beast he remembered the words in the Apocalypse:&mdash;
</p><p>
'And they worshipped the Beast, saying, Who is like unto
the Beast? who is able to make war with him?
</p><p>
'And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet-coloured beast,
full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten
horns. And upon her forehead was a name written&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Mystery,
Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots
and Abominations of the Earth</span>."'
</p><p>
Like the Seer of Patmos, Giovanni 'wondered with a
great wonder.'

<h2>BOOK XIII<br />
<small>THE PURPLE BEAST&mdash;1503</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="bookblock center">'The beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit.'&mdash;Rev. xi. 7.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="p2">I</h3>

<p>Leonardo was threatened with a lawsuit touching his
vineyard at Fiesole, a slice of which was coveted by the
neighbouring <i>contadino</i>. He had entrusted the matter to
Giovanni Boltraffio; and wishing to speak to him, had sent
for him to Rome. On his way, Giovanni visited Orvieto to
see the famous frescoes lately painted by Luca Signorelli
in the Cappella Nuova of the cathedral. One of these
frescoes showed the coming of Antichrist.
</p><p>
Giovanni was greatly impressed by the countenance of the
enemy of God. It was not evil; it was only a face of infinite
grief. In the clear eyes, with their troubled gentleness, was
reflected the final remorse of the wisdom which has renounced
its God. The figure was beautiful, notwithstanding the satyr
ears, the claw-like fingers. And, as occurs sometimes in
delirium, Giovanni saw behind this face Another terribly like
it, a divine face, which he dared not own he recognised.
</p><p>
In the same picture, at the left, was seen the fall of Antichrist.
Soaring upward on invisible wings, assuming the
character of the Son of Man coming in the clouds to judge
the quick and the dead, he was hurled back, down to the pit
by the Archangel. These human wings, this failing flight
reawakened in Giovanni the old appalling doubts about
Leonardo, his master.
</p><p>
There were two other persons in the chapel with Giovanni
also looking at the frescoes; a stout monk, and a long lean
man of uncertain age with a keen hungry face, in the garb
of a 'goliard,' as the itinerant scholars of the middle ages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
were called. They made friends with Giovanni, and the
three continued their journey in company. The monk was
a German, Tomaso Schweinitz, the librarian of an Augustinian
monastery at Nuremberg; he was going to Rome about
certain disputed benefices. His companion was also German,
Hans Platter, from Salzburg; he was acting partly as
Schweinitz's secretary, partly as his jester, partly as his
groom. On the journey the three discussed ecclesiastical
affairs. Calmly and with scientific acumen, Schweinitz
demonstrated the absurdity of imputing infallibility to the
Pope, and prophesied that within twenty years Germany would
shake off the intolerable yoke of the Romish church.
</p><p>
'This man will never die for his creed,' thought Giovanni,
looking at the full-fed round face of the Nuremberg monk;
'he will not face the fire like Savonarola; yet, who knows?
he may be more dangerous to the church.'
</p><p>
One evening soon after their arrival in Rome, Giovanni
met Hans Platter in the square of St. Peter's, and the
German took him to the neighbouring Vicolo de' Sinibaldi,
where among a number of foreign taverns was a small wine-cellar
with the sign of the Silver Hedgehog. Its host was
a Czech of the Hussite heresy, Yan Khromy, who entertained
with his choicest wines all free-thinkers or enemies
of the papacy&mdash;such were indeed daily increasing, and
preparing the way for the great reformation of the church.
</p><p>
In an inner room, where only the elect were admitted, was
a fairly numerous company; and at the head of the table
sat Schweinitz, leaning back against a cask, his fat hands
resting on his paunch, his face bloated and stupid. Now
and then he raised his glass level with the candle-flame
admiring the pale gold of the Rhenish; apparently he had
already drunk more than enough.
</p><p>
Fra Martino, a violent little monk, was pouring out vials
of wrath against the extortions of the Curia Romana.
</p><p>
'Better to fall into the hands of brigands than of the
prelates here! Daily pillage! Give to the Penitenziere, to
the Protonotary, to the Cubiculary, to the door-keeper, to
the groom, to the cook, to the man who empties the slops of
her reverence, the cardinal's concubine; Lord, forgive us!
'Tis like the song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'"New Pharisees they,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord they betray!"'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
Then Hans Platter rose, his face grave, his voice drawling,
and said:&mdash;
</p><p>
'The cardinals went to their lord the Pope and inquired&mdash;"What
shall we do to be saved?" And Alexander answered:
"Why do ye ask of me? Is it not written in the Law?
'Love silver and gold with all thine heart and with all thy
mind and with all thy strength, and love thy rich neighbour
as thyself. Do this and ye shall live.'" And the Pope took
his seat upon his throne and said: "Blessed are they who
have, for they shall see my face. Blessed are they who bring
offerings, for they shall be called my sons. Blessed are they
who come in the name of gold and silver, for of them is the
Curia Romana. But woe unto you, ye who present yourselves
with empty hands! It were better that a millstone
were hanged about your necks and ye were cast into the
depth of the sea." And the cardinals answered: "All that
thou sayest we will do." And the Pope said: "Lo, I set
before you an example, that ye may spoil the people, even
as I have spoiled the living and the dead."'
</p><p>
This sally provoked great mirth. Next Otto Marburg the
organ-master, a handsome old man, with a boyish smile, read
a satire just printed and already handed about all over the
city. It was in the form of an anonymous letter to Paolo
Savelli, a rich noble who had fled to the emperor from the
persecutions of the Church. A long catalogue was set forth
of the crimes and abominations in the house of the pontiff,
beginning with simony, and ending with Cæsar's fratricide
and the pope's criminal amours with his own daughter.
The epistle concluded with a passionate appeal to all princes
and rulers in Europe, calling on them to unite and destroy
this nest of assassins, these filthy reptiles disguised in the
semblance of men; and asseverated that the reign of Antichrist
had commenced, for of a truth the faith of the church
of God had never had such foes as Pope Alexander <span class="smcap lowercase">VI</span>. and
Cæsar his son.
</p><p>
A discussion now arose as to whether, in very truth, the
Pope were Antichrist. Otto Marburg said No; not he
but Cæsar, who, it was clear, intended to be Alexander's
successor. Fra Martino argued that Antichrist would be
an incorporeal phantom; for, as said St. Cyril of Alexandria,
'The Son of Perdition, called Antichrist, is none other than
Satan himself.'
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
Schweinitz shook his head and quoted St. John Chrysostom,
who said, 'Who is this? Is he Satan? By no means,
but a man who shall have inherited Satan's power, for there
are two beings in him: one human, the other devilish. And
he shall be the son of a virgin, which could never have been
said of Alexander or of Cæsar.'
</p><p>
But Schweinitz further quoted from Ephraim of Syria:
'The devil shall seduce a virgin of the tribe of Dan, and she
shall conceive and bring forth.'
</p><p>
All crowded round him with questions and doubts; but
imposing silence with his finger, and quoting from Jerome,
Cyprian, Irenæus, and other of the fathers, he spoke further
of the coming of Antichrist.
</p><p>
His face shall be as the face of a were-wolf, yet to many it
shall seem like the face of Christ. And he shall do marvellous
things. He shall bid the sea be still, and the sun
turn into darkness; and the mountains remove, and the
stones become bread. And he shall feed the hungry,
and heal the sick, and the deaf, and the blind, and the
feeble-kneed.
</p><p>
'Ah, the abominable dog!' cried Fra Martino beside himself,
and thumping his fist on the table; 'but who will believe
in him? Fra Tomaso, I think that not even babes could be
taken by his deceits!'
</p><p>
'They will believe. Many will believe,' said Schweinitz
shaking his head. 'He shall lead them astray by the mask
of sanctity. For he shall mortify his flesh, live chastely, contemning
the love of women; he shall taste no meat, and shall
be loving not only to men but to all living creatures which
have breath. And like the wild partridge he shall utter a
strange call and shall deceive with his voice; "Come unto me,"
he shall say, "all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I
will give you rest."'
</p><p>
'Then,' interrupted Giovanni with bated breath, 'who shall
recognise, who unmask him?'
</p><p>
The monk fixed on the youth a profound and scrutinising
regard and answered: 'It will be impossible for men, but not for
God. Even the saints shall not know to distinguish the light
from the darkness. And there shall be weariness unto all
nations, and confounding such as there was not from the
beginning of the world. And they shall say to the mountains,
"Fall on us, and to the hills, cover us," and shall faint for fear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
and for expectation of the woes which are coming on the earth,
for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. Then he who
impiously sitteth on the throne, in the very Temple of the Most
High, shall say, "O faithless generation! Ye ask for a sign and
a sign shall be given unto you. Ye shall behold me, the Son
of Man, coming in the clouds to judge both the quick and
the dead." And he shall take great wings, formed by devilish
cunning, and shall soar into the sky amid thunders and
lightnings, surrounded by his disciples in the semblance of
angels.'
</p><p>
Giovanni listened, pale as death, his eyes terror-struck; he
remembered the broad folds of the raiment of Antichrist in
Luca Signorelli's fresco; and he remembered also the folds
flapping in the wind on Leonardo's shoulders as he stood
upon the precipice edge on the lonely summit of Monte
Albano.
</p><p>
At this moment, from the larger room, whither Hans
Platter had fled from the too serious discussion, came cries
and the laughter of girls, the sound of running to and fro, the
noise of overturned chairs and broken glasses&mdash;evidently Hans
romping with the servant-maids. Presently to the jangling of
strings rang out the old song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h3>II</h3>

<p>At the hospital of San Spirito in Rome Leonardo had
returned to his anatomical studies, assisted by Giovanni.
</p><p>
Noticing his pupil's low spirits, and wishing to divert him,
the Master one day proposed to take him to the Vatican.
The Pope had convened an assembly of learned men to
discuss the boundaries of Spanish and Portuguese territory
in the new world, with regard to which decision had been
requested from the head of the church. Curiosity prompted
Giovanni to accept the invitation. Accordingly the two set
out for the Vatican.
</p><p>
Passing through the Hall of the Popes, where Alexander
had invested Cæsar with the Golden Rose, they entered
the inner chambers (now called the Apartamenti Borgia).
The arches and vaulting, and the mural spaces between
the arches had all been decorated by Pinturicchio with
brilliant frescoes&mdash;scenes from the New Testament, from the
lives of the saints; scenes also from the pagan mysteries.
Osiris was seen at his espousals with Isis, teaching men
to till the ground, to gather fruits, to plant the vine;
he was shown slain of men, rising again, leaving the earth,
reappearing as the White Bull, the blameless Apis. However
strange this deification of the Bull of the House of Borgia
might seem in the chambers of the High Priest of Christendom,
the all-pervading joy of life harmonised the two sets of
subjects, the sacred and profane, the Christian and the pagan
mysteries, the son of Jupiter and the Son of Jehovah. In
each picture slender cypresses bent before the breeze, among
the broad hills proper to the painter's native Umbria; birds
played at the vernal sports of love; St. Elizabeth embracing
the Virgin cried, 'Blessed is the fruit of thy womb'; by her
side a boy was teaching a dog to stand on his hind legs;
in the Espousals of Osiris and Isis just such another boy was
riding naked on a sacred goose. The same spirit of delight
breathed everywhere; in the rich saloons, flower-garlanded;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
in the angels, with their censers and crosses; in the dancing,
goat footed fauns carrying thyrsi and baskets of fruit; in the
mystic Bull, the purple Beast, who, radiant as the morning
sun, seemed to pour forth the joy of living.
</p><p>
'What is this?' questioned Giovanni of himself, 'is it
blasphemy, or a childlike artlessness? Is not the sacred
emotion on the face of Elizabeth the same as that on the face
of Isis? Is there not the same prayerful ecstasy on the face
of Pope Alexander, bending the knee before the rising Lord,
and on the countenance of the Egyptian priest receiving the
sun-god slain of men and risen again in the shape of Apis?
And this god before whom the people bow, singing hymns of
praise and burning incense on his altar, this heraldic Bull of
the Borgias, transformed into a Golden Calf&mdash;is nothing else
than the Roman pontiff himself, whom the servile poets have
called a god.'</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>Cæsare magna fuit, nunc Roma est maxima · Sextus</p>
<p class="i1">Regnat Alexander, ille vir, iste Deus.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>This identification of the God and the Beast seemed to
Giovanni absurd, yet awful.
</p><p>
As he examined the magnificent paintings with which the
walls were adorned, he listened to the talk of the prelates and
great men who filled the saloons, and waited for the Pope.
</p><p>
'Whence come you, Messer Bertrando?' asked Cardinal
d'Arborea of the envoy from the court of Ferrara.
</p><p>
'From the cathedral, Monsignore.'
</p><p>
'How is His Holiness? Tired?'
</p><p>
'Not at all. He chanted as well as could possibly be.
There is in his voice something so holy, so majestic, so
angelic, that I could have imagined myself in heaven. When
he lifted the cup, not I only, but many, could scarce restrain
their tears.'
</p><p>
'Of what disorder did Cardinal Miquele die?' asked the
French ambassador abruptly.
</p><p>
'Of drinking something disagreeable,' answered Don
Juan Lopez dryly. The majority at Alexander's court were
Spaniards like himself.
</p><p>
'They say,' observed Bertrando,'that on the day after the
cardinal's death His Holiness declined to receive the Spanish
ambassador on account of his grief.'
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
All exchanged glances. There were covert meanings in
these remarks. The Pope's grief had been connected with
counting the dead man's money which proved less than he
had expected; and the unwholesome drink was the Borgia
poison, a sweet white powder which killed slowly. Alexander
had invented this easy method of acquiring money. He knew
the incomes of all the cardinals, and when he wanted money
would despatch the wealthiest of them to the other world,
and declare himself the heir. He fattened them for the table.
The German, Johann Burckhardt, master of the ceremonies,
frequently noted deaths of prelates in his diary, adding the
pregnant laconicism, <i>Biberat calicem</i>&mdash;'He had drunk of the
cup.'
</p><p>
'Is it true, Monsignore,' asked Don Pedro Carranca, a
chamberlain, 'that Cardinal Monreale is taken ill?'
</p><p>
'Really? What ails him?' cried d'Arborea alarmed.
</p><p>
'Vomiting.'
</p><p>
'<i>Dio mio! Dio mio!</i> the fourth!' sighed the poor
cardinal. 'Orsini, Ferrari, Miquele, and now Monreale!'
</p><p>
'The waters of Tiber must be bad for your Eminences,'
said Messer Bertrando slyly.
</p><p>
'One after the other! one after the other!' sighed
d'Arborea; 'to-day strong and well, to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
All became silent. From the next room entered a fresh
crowd of courtiers marshalled by Don Rodriguez Borgia, the
Pope's nephew. A murmur ran through the room.
</p><p>
'The Holy Father! The Holy Father!'
</p><p>
The crowd parted, the doors were thrown open, and into
the audience-chamber came Pope Alexander <span class="smcap lowercase">VI</span>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>III</h3>

<p>He had been singularly handsome in his youth. It was
said then that he had only to look at a woman to inspire her
with the wildest passion, as if in his eyes a force was
concentred which drew women like a magnet. Even now
his features, though blunted and coarsened by age and fat,
retained an imposing beauty of line. His skin was bronzed,
his head bald, with a few tufts of grey hair at the nape. The
nose was large and aquiline, the chin receding, the eyes
vivacious. The full protruding lips showed sensuality, yet had
something simple and naïve in their expression.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
Giovanni could see nothing terrible or cruel in his face.
Alexander Borgia possessed in the highest degree the gift of
taste; he had that attractive exterior which made whatever
he said or did appear said or done in the only right way.
</p><p>
'The Pope is seventy,' said the ambassadors, 'but he grows
daily younger. His heaviest cares last but twenty-four hours.
His temperament is cheerful; everything to which he puts
his hand turns out well. He thinks of nothing but the
reputation and the happiness of his children.'
</p><p>
The Borgias were descended from Moors of Castile; it was,
indeed, not difficult to recognise in the Pope the bronze skin,
the full scarlet lips, the flashing eyes of the African Arab.
</p><p>
'He could not have a more appropriate background,'
thought Giovanni, 'than these pictures of the joys and
triumphs of Apis, the ancient Egyptian Bull.'
</p><p>
Indeed the septuagenarian Pope seemed, in the vigour of
his health, like enough to his own heraldic Beast, the sun-god,
the god of merriment, lubricity, and generation.
</p><p>
As he entered, he was in conversation with a Jew, the
goldsmith Salomone da Sessa, who had engraved the Triumph
of Cæsar on the sword of the <i>gonfaloniere</i>. He had also
pleased the Pope by so exquisitely cutting an emerald with a
figure of Venus that Alexander had had it set on the cross
which he used when blessing the people on solemn festivals,
so that when he kissed the crucifix he should kiss also the
Goddess of Love. In spite of his crimes, Alexander was
not impious; he was really devout, particularly reverential of
the Blessed Virgin, whom he considered his gracious
Mediatress at the throne of the Most High. He was
ordering a lamp now of Salomone, an offering he had vowed
to St. Maria del Popolo, in gratitude for the recovery from
illness of Madonna Lucrezia his daughter.
</p><p>
Seating himself at the window, the Pope inspected some
precious stones; he was passionately fond of jewels. With
long shapely fingers he touched the crystals gently, his
thick lips parted in a smile; especially he admired a large
chrysoprase&mdash;darker than an emerald, with mysterious
sparkles of gold, green, and purple. Then he called for a
casket of pearls from his treasure-chest. Whenever he opened
this casket he thought of his beloved daughter, who was
herself like a pearl. He called the envoy from Ferrara,
whose duke, Alfonso d'Este, was his son-in-law.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
'Take heed, Bertrando, that you do not leave Rome till I
have given you a present for Madonna Lucrezia. You
mustn't leave the old uncle with empty hands.' (He had
sufficient care for appearances sometimes to call Lucrezia
his niece.)
</p><p>
Taking a priceless pink Indian pearl, the size of a hazelnut,
from the casket, he held it up to the light and gloated
over it. He pictured it on Lucrezia's white bosom; he
hesitated whether he should give it to her or to the Blessed
Virgin. But reminding himself that it was sinful to take
away what had been vowed to Heaven, he handed the
pearl to Salomone, and bade him set it in a lamp between
the chrysoprase and the carbuncle, gift from the Sultan.
</p><p>
'Bertrando,' he turned again to the ambassador, 'when
you see the duchess, tell her from me to keep well, and to
pray earnestly to the Queen of Heaven. Tell her we are in
the best of health, and give her our apostolic blessing. This
evening I will send you the little gift for her.'
</p><p>
The Spanish ambassador exclaimed, drawing nearer:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Of a truth, I have never seen such richness of pearls!'
</p><p>
'Yes,' said the Pope complacently, 'I have a fine collection.
I have been making it for twenty years. My daughter is very
fond of pearls.' He laughed. 'She knows what suits her,
the little rogue!'
</p><p>
Then after a pause he added solemnly, 'When I die,
Lucrezia shall have the best pearls in Italy!'
</p><p>
And plunging his hands in them he let them trickle
through his fingers, delighting in their soft pale splendour
and smooth, satin-like texture.
</p><p>
'All for her! All for her, our delicious daughter,' he
repeated in a low hoarse voice.
</p><p>
And suddenly a fire sparkled in his eyes; and Giovanni,
remembering whispers of the monstrous passion of the aged
Borgia for this Lucrezia, froze at heart with horror and
shame.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Just then a page announced that, according to His
Holiness's order, Cæsar was waiting in the next saloon.
Alexander had summoned him on a matter of urgent
importance: the French king had expressed disapproval of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
Valentinois' designs against Florence, and had charged the
Pope with countenancing them.
</p><p>
After listening to the page's announcement, Alexander
glanced at the French ambassador, drew him adroitly aside,
left him (accidentally, apparently) by the door of the room
where Cæsar was waiting, and passing through the door, left
it (accidentally again) slightly ajar, so that the ambassador
and those about him should hear all that passed between
father and son.
</p><p>
Soon vehement reproaches were audible. Cæsar spoke
calmly and respectfully, but the old man, stamping his foot,
cried furiously:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Out of my sight! Choke, son of a cur! son of a harlot!'
</p><p>
'<i>Dio mio</i>, do you hear?' whispered the Frenchman to
Messer Antonio Giustiniani, the Venetian ambassador, 'he
will strike him!'
</p><p>
The Venetian shrugged his shoulders. If it came to blows,
he thought the son more likely to stab the father, than the
father the son. Since the murder of the Duke of Candia,
the Pope had feared Cæsar; his paternal pride and doting
fondness had become mixed with a superstitious terror. All
remembered how Perotto, the youngest of the chamberlains,
had taken refuge from Cæsar under the folds of the papal
mantle, and Cæsar had poniarded him on the pontiff's breast,
splashing Alexander with his blood. Giustiniani guessed
also that the present dispute was a feint, got up for the
Frenchman's benefit, to persuade him that if the duke had
designs against Florence the Pope was innocent of them.
Giustiniani believed that the two always supported each
other; the father never doing what he said, the son never
saying what he did.
</p><p>
Having threatened, cursed, and all but excommunicated
his son, the Pope returned to the hall of audience still
trembling, panting, and wiping the perspiration from his
empurpled face. Nevertheless, in his eyes shone a gleam of
amusement. Again he called the Frenchman, and this time
drew him towards the Cortile del Belvedere.
</p><p>
'Your Holiness knows,' began the envoy, much distressed,
'I had no desire to breed discord&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
'What? did you hear?' cried the Pope, seeming much
astonished. And without giving him time to think, he
took him familiarly by the chin with finger and thumb (a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
sign of great amity), and spoke impetuously of his devotion
to the Most Christian King, and of the extraordinary purity
of Cæsar's motives. The Frenchman was bewildered, and
though he had irrefragable proof of the deception, felt disposed
rather to deny the evidence of his own eyes than to disbelieve
that voice, those eyes, those lips. Indeed, Alexander always
lied like one inspired. He never pre-arranged what he was
going to say, but lied as artlessly, as innocently as a woman
in love. He had practised this art so long that he had
attained perfection in it; he was an artist carried away by his
imagination.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>V</h3>

<p>At this moment his secret body-servant approached the pope
and whispered to him. Alexander with an anxious air passed
into the next room, and thence through a concealed door into
a narrow vaulted passage where Cardinal Monreale's cook was
awaiting him.
</p><p>
He brought news that the quantity of poison had been
insufficient and the cardinal was recovering. However, after
minutely catechising the cook, the Pope convinced himself
that his victim would die in two or three months' time, which
would be all the better as averting suspicion.
</p><p>
'It seems a pity, too!' thought Alexander. 'The poor old
man was amusing and a good Christian.'
</p><p>
Wishing he could have got the money in some other way,
he sighed and returned to the audience hall. In the adjoining
chamber, sometimes used as a refectory, he saw a table laid
and felt hungry. Deferring the business matters, he invited the
company to dinner. The table was ornamented with white
lilies, the flower of the Annunciation, a favourite with the
pope, who said it reminded him of Madonna Lucrezia. The
dishes were not numerous, for the pope was plain and sparing
in his diet. Giovanni listened to the talk among the
chamberlains.
</p><p>
Don Juan Lopez, the 'laterculensis,' spoke of the late dispute
between father and son, and defended Cæsar as if he had no
suspicion that the whole affair had been a comedy. The rest
agreed with him and lauded Cæsar to the skies.
</p><p>
'Ah no,' said the Pope shaking his head with reproachful
tenderness, 'you don't know what he is. A day never passes
in which I am not in terror about him lest he should commit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
some new imprudence. He will end by breaking his neck and
bringing us all to ruin.'
</p><p>
His eyes sparkled with paternal pride.
</p><p>
'But what makes Cæsar like this?' he went on; 'whom
does he take after? You know me, a simple and guileless old
man; what I have in my heart, that comes from my tongue!
But Cæsar, Lord knows, keeps counsel; always hiding something.
Believe me, sirs, sometimes I reprove and scold at
him, and at the same time I have terror in my soul. That's
it. I am afraid of my own son! He is polite&mdash;ay, too
polite; and then of a sudden he looks me a look like a dagger
in my heart.'
</p><p>
The guests, however, defended Cæsar still more warmly.
</p><p>
'Oh, I know! I know!' said the Pope, 'you love him like
your own, and won't let us abuse him.'
</p><p>
The room was suffocatingly hot, and Alexander's head swam,
not from wine, but from the intoxication of his son's glory.
They all rose and went forth on the balcony which gave on
the Cortile del Belvedere. The air was pure and delicious;
below, the grooms were bringing fiery mares and ardent
stallions out of the stables.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Surrounded by the cardinals and dignitaries, the Pope stood
watching the horses, long silent. Gradually his face clouded,
for he remembered Lucrezia. Her image rose before him;
her blue eyes, the pale gold of her hair, her rosy lips a little
full like his own; pure and dainty as a pearl; docile and
gentle; in the midst of evil, knowing it not; passionless and
unsullied. Why had he consented to her marriage with Alfonso
d'Este, the Duke of Ferrara?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sighing heavily, with drooping head, as if for the first time
the burden of age had fallen on his shoulders, he led the company
back to the Hall of Audience.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Globes, maps, compasses were there lying ready for the
marking out of the meridian, which was to pass over a point
three hundred and seventy Portuguese leagues to the south of
the Azores and the island of Cape de Verde. This point was
chosen because, according to Columbus, the 'navel of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
earth' was there; the pear-like projection, the mountain
reaching to the lunar sphere, which he had postulated on
account of the deviation in his compass.
</p><p>
From the extreme western point of Portugal on the one side
and the coasts of Brazil on the other, even distances were
to be measured to the proposed line. Then shipmasters and
astronomers were bidden to calculate how many days of sailing
were equal to these distances. The Pope offered prayer,
blessed the globe, and dipping a brush in red ink, drew across
the Atlantic from the North Pole to the South the broad line
which was to secure peace. All islands and lands to the east
of this line were to belong to Spain, all to the west, to
Portugal. Thus by one motion of his hand he parted the
globe in halves and divided it between the Christian nations.
At this moment Alexander seemed grand and majestic to
Giovanni; full of the consciousness of his power, the world-swaying
Cæsar-Pope, centre of two kingdoms&mdash;the earthly
and the heavenly.
</p><p>
That same evening in his apartments in the Vatican, Cæsar
Borgia gave a feast to His Holiness and the Sacred College of
Cardinals, at which were present 'fifty of the fairest and most
famous of the Roman <i>cortigiane oneste</i>;' called officially
'<i>meretrices honestæ nuncupatæ</i>.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus was celebrated that memorable day in the annals of
the Church, which had been marked by the partition of the
globe.
</p><p>
Leonardo was present at the supper and witnessed everything.
Invitations to such feasts were great favours, and could
not be declined. On returning home he said to Giovanni:&mdash;
</p><p>
'In every man there is a god and a beast, coupled.'
</p><p>
Going on with his anatomical drawing, he added&mdash;
</p><p>
'Persons with base minds and unworthy passions do not
merit so complex and beautiful a physical structure as others,
of high intelligence and lofty thoughts. 'Twere enough if
they had a bag with two openings, one to receive, the other
to eject food; for, in plain fact, they be no more than a
passage for nourishment.'
</p><p>
Next morning Giovanni found the Master at work on his
painting '<i>San Gerolamo nel deserto</i>.' In a savage den, the
recluse, kneeling and gazing at the Crucified, beats his breast so
vehemently that the lion at his feet looks into his eyes, and has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
opened his jaws in a long and pitiful moan, as if in compassion
for his master.
</p><p>
Boltraffio remembered that other picture, white Leda
embraced by the swan, the Goddess consumed by the flames
of Savonarola's pyre. And as so often before, he asked
himself again which of these opposed conceptions was dearest
to the heart of the master? or could the two be equally dear?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Summer came. Putrid fever of the Pontine marshes, the
'malaria,' began to rage in the city; at the end of July
there were daily deaths among those about the Pope. He
himself appeared troubled and sad; but it was less the fear
of death which was oppressing him, than the absence of his
idolised Lucrezia. He had before now had several attacks
of fierce desire, blind and dumb, like madness, terrifying
even to himself; he fancied that if he did not satisfy them
at once they would suffocate him. He wrote begging her
to come for a few days; she replied that her husband would
not permit her to leave him. The aged Borgia would have
shrunk from no crime to rid himself of this detested son-in-law
as he had rid himself of Lucrezia's earlier husbands. But
there was no jesting with the Duke of Ferrara, for he had the
finest artillery in Italy.
</p><p>
At the beginning of August Alexander went to the villa of
Cardinal Adrian of Corneto. At supper he ate more heartily
than usual, and drank heavy Sicilian wines; afterwards he sat
long on the terrace, enjoying the insidious freshness of the
Roman night. Next morning he felt himself indisposed. It
was told afterwards that having approached the window he
saw two funerals, that of his favourite chamberlain, and that
of Messer Guglielmo Raimondi, both men heavy in figure
like himself.
</p><p>
'The season is dangerous for us fat folk,' he murmured forebodingly.
The words were no sooner uttered than a dove
flew in at the window, dashed itself against the wall, and fell
stunned at the feet of His Holiness.
</p><p>
'Another omen,' he muttered, turning pale; and at once
he went to his apartment and lay down. In the night he
was seized with violent vomiting. The physicians had
different opinions about his malady; some called it a tertian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
fever; others apoplexy, others inflammation of the gall
bladder. In the town it was said that he was poisoned.
</p><p>
Every hour his strength declined. Ten days later they
had recourse to their extreme measure, and gave him a
decoction of precious stones reduced to powder. Still he
grew worse.
</p><p>
One night, awaking from delirium, he fumbled anxiously in
his breast for a small gold reliquary worn by him for many
years and containing minute particles of the body and blood
of the Lord. The astrologers had told him his life was safe
so long as he carried it. But now, whether it had been lost
or stolen, it could nowhere be found, and he closed his eyes
in the calm of despair, saying&mdash;
</p><p>
'It means I am to go: all is ended.'
</p><p>
Next morning, feeling the weakness of death coming over
him, he required all to leave him except his favourite
physician, the Bishop of Venosa. Him he reminded of the
remedy employed by a Hebrew doctor on his predecessor,
Innocent <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, namely, the injection into the veins of the dying
Pope of the blood of three children newly slain.
</p><p>
'Does your Holiness know how it ended?' asked the bishop.
</p><p>
'I know! I know!' said Alexander faintly. 'But the
children were seven years old and they should have been
unweaned.'
</p><p>
The bishop made no reply; already the sick man's eyes
were clouding, and he fell back into delirium.
</p><p>
'Yes; quite young: little white ones! They whose blood
is pure and scarlet. I love children! Let them come to
me. <i>Sinite parvulos ad me venire!</i> Suffer little children
to come unto me!' ...
</p><p>
At these ravings, even the imperturbable bishop, long
inured to the horrors of the court, could not repress a
shudder. With monotonous convulsive movements, the Pope
still fumbled and groped in his bosom for the vanished
reliquary.
</p><p>
During his illness he had never once mentioned his children.
They told him that Cæsar, like himself, lay at death's door,
but he remained unmoved. Now they asked him if he
desired any last message to his son or his daughter, but he
turned away his head and said no word. It seemed as if
those, whom in his lifetime he had so passionately loved, no
longer had any existence for him.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
On the 18th, Friday, he confessed to his chaplain, and
made his communion. At the hour of vespers they read the
prayers for the dying. Several times he made an effort to
speak, and Cardinal Ilerda, bending down, at last caught the
faint sounds coming from his cold lips:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Quick! quick! The Stabat Mater! the hymn to my
Mediatress!' he whispered.
</p><p>
The hymn is not included in the office for the dying, but
Ilerda repeated it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Stabat Mater dolorosa</p>
<p>&nbsp;Juxta Crucem lacrimosa</p>
<p>&nbsp;Dum pendebat Filius....'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>An ineffable comfort shone in the dying eyes, as if he saw
heaven opened and his Mediatress waiting. He stretched
out his hands, shuddered, raised himself, and murmured:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Cast me not away, O Holy Virgin!'
</p><p>
Then he fell back on his pillows. He was dead.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>At the same time Cæsar Borgia likewise lay between life and
death. Monsignor Gaspare Torella, his episcopal physician,
ordered a heroic remedy; the patient was to be plunged into
the belly of a newly-slain mule, then into icy water. Whether
by virtue of this severe treatment, or of his extraordinary
strength of will, Cæsar recovered.
</p><p>
During all those terrible days he had maintained complete
calmness and self-possession. He followed the course of
events, listened to reports, dictated letters, and issued orders.
When news came of the Pope's death, he had himself transported
by the secret passage from the Vatican to the Castle
of St. Angelo.
</p><p>
Strange stories touching Alexander's death were circulated
through the town. Marin Sanuto reported to the Republic
of Venice that an ape had come into his room, and when one
of the cardinals would have captured it, the Pope cried out:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Let it alone! Let it alone! It is the devil!'
</p><p>
'It was also said that he frequently cried out:&mdash;
</p><p>
'I will come! I will come! Do but wait a little longer!'
</p><p>
And the explanation ran, that upon the death of Innocent
<span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span>, Rodrigo Borgia had sold himself to the Evil One for
the sake of twenty years of the papal power.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
Again it was related that at the moment of death, seven
demons appeared at his pillow; and he was no sooner dead
than the body began to rock and to boil, and steam came
from his mouth as from a cauldron; his form swelled till it
had lost all human shape, and his face became black as an
Ethiopian's.
</p><p>
It was the custom upon the death of a Pope to say funeral
masses for nine days at St. Peter's, but such was the terror
inspired by this deformed and putrefying corpse, that none
could be induced to undertake these extreme offices. There
were no lights about the bier, nor incense, nor guards, nor
mourners. It was long before any could be found to put him
in a coffin. At last six ruffians undertook the task for a
bottle of wine. The coffin was too small, but the triple crown
having been lifted from the head, the body was rolled in a
ragged cloth and forced into the receptacle. It was indeed
whispered that he had no coffin, but was dropped into a pit
head foremost like a victim of the plague.
</p><p>
But even after its burial this poor corpse was allowed no
pardon; the superstitious terrors of the people augmented
daily. The very air seemed polluted, and a pervading loathsome
stench was added to the epidemic fever. A black dog
appeared in St. Peter's, running round and round in ever
widening circles. The inhabitants of the Borgo dared not
leave their homes after nightfall. Many were convinced that
Alexander had not died a natural death, but would reappear
on the throne, and the reign of Antichrist would begin.
</p><p>
All these and similar reports did Giovanni Boltraffio hear
in the Vicolo Sinibaldi, in the wine-cellar of Yan Khromy,
the lame Czech Hussite.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Meantime Leonardo, careless of political events and removed
from all his friends, was working on a picture begun
some time ago to the order of the Servite monks of Santa
Maria Annunziata at Florence. It represented St. Anne and
the Virgin Mary; perfect knowledge and perfect love. St.
Anne was like a sibyl, eternally young; on her downcast
eyes, on her delicately curved lips, there played a mystery
of seduction, full of the wisdom of the serpent, not unlike
Leonardo's own smile. Beside her, the face of Mary, childish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
and simple, breathed the innocence of the dove. She knew
because she loved, while Anne loved because she knew.
Looking at this picture, Giovanni thought that for the first
time he understood the master's saying, 'that Great Love is
the daughter of Great Knowledge.' Leonardo at this time
was also designing machines of various kinds and shapes,
gigantic cranes, pumps, saws, borers; weaving, fulling, rope-making,
and smith's apparatus.
</p><p>
As often before, Giovanni was astonished that he could
occupy himself simultaneously in such widely different ways,
but the seeming discord was intentional.
</p><p>
'I maintain,' he wrote in his <i>Principles of Mechanics</i>,
'that Force is something spiritual and unseen&mdash;spiritual, because
the life in it is incorporeal; unseen, because the body
in which the force is generated changes neither its weight
nor its aspect.'
</p><p>
Leonardo's destiny was decided with that of Cæsar Borgia.
The latter, though he never lost audacity and calm, felt that
fortune had betrayed him. At the time of the Pope's death
and Cæsar's own illness, their enemies leagued themselves and
seized the Roman Campagna. Prospero Colonna advanced
to the city gates, Baglioni on Perugia. Urbino, Camerino,
Piombino recovered their independence. The conclave,
assembled for the election of the new Pope, demanded the
removal of the duke from Rome. The whole order of things
was changed; it seemed as if all were lost.
</p><p>
Those who had trembled before 'the elect of Heaven,' as
Machiavelli had called him, now rejoiced at his overthrow,
and kicked the dying lion with asses's hoofs. The poets
furnished epigrams:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Cæsar or nothing! Both we find in thee,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Who Cæsar wast, and soon shalt nothing be.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Leonardo, conversing one day in the Vatican with Antonio
Giustiniani the Venetian, turned the conversation on
Machiavelli.
</p><p>
'Has he told you of his book on statecraft?'
</p><p>
'Oh yes; he has mentioned it frequently, but no doubt he
spoke in jest. That is not a book to give to the world!
Who writes such books? Counsel to rulers? Revelation of
the secrets of government?&mdash;showing that all rule is violence
covered by a mask of justice? 'Twere to teach the hens the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
methods of the fox; to arm the sheep with wolf's teeth!
God guard us from such politics!'
</p><p>
'Then you think Messer Niccolò in error, and that he will
change his opinions?'
</p><p>
'Nay! my opinion is with him! We do well to act as he
counsels; only let us not <i>speak</i> it. Yet if he do give his
book to the world, I doubt it will harm any but himself. The
sheep and the fowls will go on trusting the wolves and the
foxes. All will be invariable as before. God is merciful;
the world will last our time.'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>X</h3>

<p>In the autumn of 1503 Piero Soderini, Perpetual Gonfaloniere
of Florence, invited Leonardo to enter his service,
intending to employ him in the construction of military
engines for the siege of Pisa. The stay of the artist in Rome
was therefore nearing its close.
</p><p>
One evening he wandered on the Palatine Hill, where had
stood the palaces of Augustus, Caligula, and Septimius
Severus. Now only the wind howled in the ruins, and
among the olives and the acanthus was heard the bleating
of sheep and the chirrup of the grasshopper. The
ground was strewn with marble fragments, and Leonardo
knew that statues of rare beauty of the gods and heroes of
the ancient world were buried under the ruins, like dead men
awaiting the resurrection. The evening was serene and fair;
the brick skeletons of arches, vaults, and walls, glowed fiery
in the rays of the sinking sun. The autumn foliage was all
scarlet and gold, as once had been the chambers of the
Roman emperors.
</p><p>
On the northern slope of the hill, not far from the gardens
of Capranica, Leonardo knelt to examine a fragment of
marble. At this moment a man appeared on the tangled
footpath.
</p><p>
'Is it you, Messer Niccolò?' said Leonardo, rising and
embracing him.
</p><p>
The Florentine secretary seemed still shabbier than when
Leonardo had made his acquaintance on the road to Fano;
it was evident that the Signoria still neglected him. He was
thin, his shaven cheeks seemed quite blue, his long neck
bent wearily, his nose seemed more prominent and beak-like,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
his eyes more fevered. Leonardo asked him of his
whereabouts and his affairs; but when he spoke of Cæsar,
Niccolò turned away, shrugging his shoulders and replying
with simulated indifference:&mdash;
</p><p>
'I have seen strange things in my life; I no longer wonder
at anything;' and then he fell to questioning Leonardo as if
anxious to change the subject. When he heard that his friend
had entered the service of Florence, Machiavelli cried:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Be not elated! God only knows which is the worse, the
crimes of a hero like Cæsar, or the virtues of our ant-hill of a
republic. Oh, I know the beauties of a popular government!'
and he smiled bitterly.
</p><p>
Leonardo told him Giustiniani's parable of the hens and
the foxes, the sheep and the wolves.
</p><p>
'Truth remains truth,' said Niccolò, restored to good
humour. 'True, I irritate the hens and the foxes too; they
are ready to burn me at the stake for being the first to
describe what they have all being doing ever since the world
began. The tyrants think me an inciter to revolution, the
populace believe me in league with the tyrants, the religious
call me an infidel, the good call me wicked, and the wicked
hate me more than they all because I seem to them more
wicked than themselves. Ah, Messer Leonardo, do you
recall our conversations? You and I have a common fate.
The discovery of new truths is, and has ever been, more
dangerous than discovery of new lands. You and I are
solitary in a crowd, strangers, superfluous, homeless wanderers,
perpetual outcasts. He who is unlike others is alone against
all; for the world has been created for the masses, and outside
the vulgar no one is anything. Ay, my friend, this is a
serious matter, for it means that life is tedious; and the
worst misfortune in life is not sickness, nor poverty, nor grief;
but tediousness.'
</p><p>
In silence they descended the western slope of the
Palatine, and by the Via della Consolazione reached the
foot of the Capitol, the ruins of the temple of Saturn, the place
where in the days of glory had stood the Forum Romanum.
</p><p>
From the Arch of Septimius Severus, as far as to the
Flavian amphitheatre, the Via Sacra was flanked by wretched
hovels. Their foundations were formed of fragments of
statues, of the limbs and torsos of Olympian gods. For
centuries the forum had been a quarry. Christian churches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
languished on the ruins of pagan shrines. Layer upon layer
of street rubbish, of dust, of filth, had raised the level of the
ground more than ten cubits. Yet still lofty columns soared
upwards and carried sculptured architraves&mdash;last traces of a
vanished art.
</p><p>
Machiavelli showed his companion the site of the Roman
Senate, the Curia, where now a cattle-market was held,
giving to the whole glorious area the ignoble name of
'Campo Vaccino.' Huge white bullocks, and the black
buffaloes of the Pontine marshes lay on the ground, swine
routed in the puddles, liquid mire and every sort of filth
befouled the fallen columns, the marble slabs, the half-defaced
inscriptions. A feudal tower, once the stronghold
of the <i>Frangipani</i>, leaned against the Arch of Titus; beside
it was a tavern for the peasants who came to the market.
Cries of brawling women were heard through the windows,
and the refuse of meat and fish was flung out by careless
hands. Half-washed rags were dried on a string, and
beneath them sat an aged and deformed beggar, bandaging
his sore and swollen foot. Behind this squalor rose
the arch, white and pure, less shattered than the remaining
monuments. Bas-reliefs adorned both sides of the interior;
on the right Titus the conqueror, on the left the captive Jews
with their altar, shewbread, and seven-branched candlestick,
mere trophies for the victor; at the top of the arch a broad-winged
eagle bearing the deified Cæsar to Olympus. Machiavelli
read the inscription in sonorous tones: '<i>Senatus
Populusque Romanus divo Tito divi Vespasiani filio Vespasiano
Augusto</i>.'
</p><p>
The sunlight coming through the arch from the direction
of the Capitol lit up the emperor's triumph, the malodorous
curls of smoke from the tavern seemed like clouds of incense.
Niccolò's heart beat as, turning once more to the Forum, he
saw the light on the three exquisite columns before the
church of St. Maria Liberatrice; the dreary jangling of the
bells sounding the Ave Maria seemed to him a dirge over
fallen greatness. They directed their steps to the Coliseum.
</p><p>
'Ay,' he said, contemplating the titanic blocks of which the
amphitheatre's walls are made, 'those who could erect such
monuments were more than our equals. 'Tis only here in
Rome that one can feel the difference between us and the
ancients. We are unable even to figure what men they were.'
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>

'I know not,' said Leonardo, awaking with an effort from
his musing; 'we of this age have not less force than the
ancients; only 'tis force of another sort.'
</p><p>
'Christian humility, I suppose?'
</p><p>
'Ay, humility amongst other things, perhaps.'
</p><p>
'It may be so,' said Niccolò coldly.
</p><p>
They seated themselves on a broken step of the amphitheatre.
</p><p>
'Men should either accept Christ or reject him,' exclaimed
Machiavelli in a sudden outburst; 'we do neither the one
nor the other. We are neither Christian nor heathen. We
have fallen away from the one, and have not submitted to
the other. We have not the strength for righteousness, we
have not the courage for wickedness. We are neither black
nor white, but a scurvy grey; neither cold nor hot, but a
mawkish lukewarm. We have become so false, so pusillanimous,
we have twisted about, and halted so long between
Christ and Belial, that now we neither know what we want
nor whither we are tending. The ancients at least knew that
much, and were logical to the end; did not pretend to turn
the right cheek to him who smote the left. But since men
began to believe that to earn paradise they should suffer any
injustice, any violence on earth, an open door has been set
before rascals. Is it not a fact that Christianity has paralysed
the world, and made it a prey to villains?'
</p><p>
His voice shook, his eyes flashed with consuming hatred,
his face was contorted as if from unendurable pain.
</p><p>
Leonardo made no answer. He gazed at the blue heavens
shining through gaps in the Coliseum walls; and he reflected
that nowhere did the azure sky seem so radiant and stainless
as in the interstices of ruins. Birds were flitting in and out
of the holes left where the barbarians had wrenched away the
iron bars. Leonardo watched them fluttering to their
roosting places; and he thought how the world-swaying
Cæsars, who had erected the building, and the northern
hordes who had pillaged it, had worked for those of whom it
is written: 'They sow not, neither do they reap; and God
feedeth them.'
</p><p>
Everything to Leonardo was joy, to Niccolò all was
vexation; honey to one was gall to the other; perfected
knowledge had bred love in the one, hatred in the other.
But Machiavelli interrupted these musings, as usual anxious
to end the conversation with a joke:&mdash;
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
'I perceive, Messer Leonardo, that they who think you
impious stand in gross error. In the Judgment, when the
angelic trump shall separate the lambs from the wolves, you
will be among lambs.'
</p><p>
'Well,' said the painter, falling in with his humour, 'if I
get to Paradise, you will come with me.'
</p><p>
'I cry you mercy! I have suffered overmuch in this world
from tedium! My place I will give to any anxious for it.
Hearken, good friend, and I will relate to you a dream. I
was taken into an assembly of hungered, unwashen outcasts,
monks with yellow faces, old beggars, slaves, cripples, idiots,
and taught that these were they of whom it is written:
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
Heaven." Then they had me to another place, where I saw
an assembly of men in semblance like Senators. Among
them were emperors, and popes, and captains, and lawgivers,
and philosophers; Homer, Alexander the Great, Marcus
Aurelius. They talked of learning and of statecraft. And
to my wonderment I was told this was hell, and these were
all sinners cast out by God, because they had loved the world
and the wisdom of the world, which is foolishness with the
Lord. And I was bidden to choose between hell and heaven,
and I cried: "To hell with me! With the sages and the
heroes!"'
</p><p>
'If the reality be as you describe it,' said Leonardo, 'I also
should prefer ...'
</p><p>
'Nay, it is too late! You have made your choice. You
will be rewarded for Christian virtues by a Christian heaven!'
</p><p>
They lingered in the Coliseum till dark. The yellow moon
had sailed up from behind the stupendous arches of the
Basilica of Constantine, severing with her rays a bed of
cloud, transparent and delicately tinted as mother-o'-pearl.
The three columns in front of St. Maria Liberatrice shone
like phantoms. And the cracked bell sounding the Christian
'Angelus' seemed more than ever like a dirge over the
trampled and forgotten Romans.</p>

<h2>BOOK XIV<br />
<small>MONNA LISA GIOCONDA&mdash;1503-1506</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="bookblock">'The darkness of that subterranean place was too deep, and when I
had passed some time therein, two feelings awoke within me and contended&mdash;fear
and curiosity; fear of exploring that dark depth; curiosity
as to its secret.'</p>
<p class="right ph bookblock">Leonardo da Vinci.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="p2">I</h3>

<p>Leonardo used to say:&mdash;
</p><p>
'For portraits, have a special studio; a court, oblong and
rectangular, ten <i>braccia</i> in width, twenty in length, the walls
painted black, with a projecting roof and canvas curtains for
the sun. Or, if you haven't the canvas curtains, paint only
in the twilight, or when it is clouded and dull. That is the
perfect light.'
</p><p>
Just such a court for the painting of portraits he had made
for himself in the house of the Florentine citizen who lodged
him; a notable personage, commissary of the Signoria, a
mathematician, a man of intellect and of amiability, his name
Ser Piero di Braccio Martelli. His house was the second in
the Via Martelli, on the left as one goes from San Giovanni
to the Palazzo Medici.
</p><p>
It was a warm misty afternoon, towards the close of spring,
in the year 1505. The sun shone through clouds; there was
a dull light, which seemed as if shining under water, throwing
delicate liquid shadows&mdash;Leonardo's favourite condition of
the atmosphere; which, he thought, gave special charm to
the face of a woman.
</p><p>
'Will she come?' he asked himself, thinking of her whose
portrait he had been painting for nearly three years, with a
tenacity and a zeal unwonted.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
He arranged the studio for her reception. Boltraffio,
watching him, marvelled at his unusual solicitude.
</p><p>
He prepared palette, brushes, and skins of paint, each
one coated with a transparent film of gum arabic. He
removed the cover from the portrait, which was disposed
on a movable three-legged stand called a <i>leggio</i>. He set
the fountain playing in the middle of the court. It had
been constructed for her delight&mdash;falling streams striking
against glass spheres put them in motion and produced a
strange low music. Her favourite flowers had been planted
round the fountain&mdash;pale irises&mdash;the lilies of Florence.
Then he crumbled bread in a basket for the tame doe which
lived in the court, and which she used to feed with her own
hands; lastly, he arranged her chair, of smooth dark oak with
carved back and arms; before it placed a soft rug, upon which
was already curled and purring a white cat of a rare breed,
procured for her pleasure, a dainty foreign beast with varicoloured
eyes, the right yellow as a topaz, the left sapphire
blue.
</p><p>
Meantime, Andrea Salaino had begun to tune the viol;
another musician, one Atalante, whom Leonardo had known
at the Milanese court, brought the silver lyre, shaped like a
horse's head, which the artist had invented.
</p><p>
The best musicians, singers, story-tellers, and poets, the
most witty talkers, were invited by Leonardo to his studio
to amuse <i>her</i>, and avert the tedium of her sittings. He
studied the changeful beauty of <i>her</i> expression as reflects of
thought and feeling were awakened by talk, music, poetry,
in turn.
</p><p>
Now all was ready, but still she delayed her coming.
</p><p>
'Where is she?' he thought; 'the light and the shadow
to-day are just her own. Shall I send to seek her? Nay,
but she knows how ardently I await her! She will come.'
</p><p>
And Giovanni noticed that his impatience grew.
</p><p>
Suddenly a light waft of the breeze swayed the jet of the
fountain, the delicate irises shook as the spray fell on them.
The keen-eared doe was on the alert, with outstretched neck.
Leonardo listened. And Giovanni, though he heard nothing,
knew it was <i>she</i>.
</p><p>
First, with a humble reverence, came Sister Camilla, a lay-companion
who lived with her, and always attended her to
the studio, sitting quietly apart studying a prayer-book, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
effacing herself, so that in three years Leonardo had hardly
heard her voice. The sister was followed by the woman all
expected; a woman of thirty, in a plain dark dress, and a
dark transparent veil which reached to the centre of her
forehead&mdash;Monna Lisa Gioconda.
</p><p>
She was a Neapolitan of noble birth; her father, Antonio
Gherardini, had lost his wealth in the French invasion of
1495, and had married his daughter to the Florentine,
Francesco del Giocondo, who had seen the death of two
wives already. Messer Francesco was five years younger
than Leonardo; was one of the twelve <i>Bonuomini</i>, and was
likely later to be made Prior. He was a mediocre personage,
of a type to be found in every country and in every age;
neither good nor bad; busy in a commonplace way, absorbed
in his affairs, content with daily routine. He regarded
his young wife as nothing more than an ornament for his
house. Her essential charm he understood less than the
points of his Sicilian cattle, or the impost upon raw sheepskins.
She was said to have married this man solely to please
her father, and by her marriage to have driven an earlier
lover to a voluntary death. It was also said that she still
had a crowd of passionate adorers&mdash;persevering, but hopeless.
The scandalmongers could find nothing worse than this to
insinuate. Calm, gentle, retiring, pious, charitable to the
poor, she was a faithful wife, a good housekeeper, a most
tender mother to Dianora, her twelve-year-old step-daughter.
</p><p>
Giovanni knew all this of Monna Lisa. Yet she never
visited Leonardo's studio without seeming to the pupil a
wholly different person from Messer Francesco's wife. She
had been coming now for three years, and Giovanni's first
impressions had been only confirmed by subsequent observations.
He found something mysterious, illusory, phantasmal
about her which filled him with awe. Leonardo's portrait
seemed more real than she was herself. She and the painter&mdash;whom
she never saw except when sitting to him, and then
never alone&mdash;appeared to share some secret; not a love-secret,
at least not in the ordinary sense of the term.
</p><p>
Leonardo had once spoken of the tendency felt by every
artist to reproduce his own likeness in his pictures of others,
the reason of this tendency being that both his own material
semblance and his work are the creation and manifestation
of his soul. In this case Giovanni found that not merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
the portrait, but the woman herself, was growing daily
more like the painter. The likeness was less in the features
than in the expression of eyes and in the smile. But he
had already seen this smile on the lips of Verrocchio's
Unbelieving Thomas; of Eve before the Tree of Science,
Leonardo's first picture; in the Leda; in the Angel of the
<i>Madonna delle Roccie</i>; and in a hundred other drawings,
executed before ever he had met Monna Lisa: as though,
throughout life, he had sought his own reflection, and had
found it completely at last.
</p><p>
When Giovanni looked at that smile, he felt perturbed,
alarmed, as if in presence of the supernatural; reality seemed
a dream, and the dream-world reality; Monna Lisa, not the
wife of Giocondo, the very ordinary Florentine citizen, but
a phantom evoked by the will of the master, a female
semblance of Leonardo himself.
</p><p>
Lisa took her seat, and the white cat jumped on her lap;
she stroked it with delicate fingers, and faint cracklings
and sparks came from the silky fur. Leonardo began his
work; but presently he laid it aside and sat silent, looking
into her face with an intentness that no faintest shadow of
change in her expression could have escaped.
</p><p>
'Madonna,' he said at last, 'you are preoccupied&mdash;troubled
about something to-day.'
</p><p>
Giovanni had observed that to-day she did not resemble
the portrait.
</p><p>
'I am a little troubled,' she replied; 'Dianora ails, and I
have been up with her the whole night.'
</p><p>
'Then you are wearied, and the pose will try you. We
will defer the sitting to another time.'
</p><p>
'Nay, we cannot lose this delightful day! See the misty
sunlight and the delicate shadows! It is <i>my</i> day!'
</p><p>
There was a short silence. Then she went on: 'I knew
you expected me. I was ready to come earlier; but I was
kept. Madonna Sophonisba&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
'Who? Ah, I know. She with the voice of a fishwife
and the scent of a perfumer's shop!'
</p><p>
Monna Lisa smiled quietly. 'She had to tell me about
the fête at the Palazzo Vecchio, given by Argentina, wife of
the <i>Gonfaloniere</i>; of the supper, the dresses, the lovers&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
'Ay, 'tis not Dianora's indisposition has disturbed you, but
this woman's senseless gossip. Strange case! Have you never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
noticed, madonna, how sometimes a single absurdity on
an indifferent subject from an uninteresting person will
throw a gloom over the mind, and afflict us more than our
proper cares?'
</p><p>
She bent her head silently; it was clear they understood
each other too well for words to be always necessary.
</p><p>
Leonardo again addressed himself to work.
</p><p>
'Tell me something!' she cried.
</p><p>
'What shall I tell you?'
</p><p>
She smiled. 'Tell me about <i>The Realm of Venus</i>.'
</p><p>
The artist had certain favourite stories for La Gioconda;
tales of travel, of natural phenomena, of plans for pictures.
He knew them by heart, and would recite always in
the same simple half-childlike words, accompanied by soft
music, in his feminine voice, the old fable, or cradle-tale.
Andrea and Atalante took their instruments, and when they
had executed the <i>motif</i> which invariably preluded <i>The Realm
of Venus</i>, he began:&mdash;
</p><p>
'The seafarers who live on the coasts of Cilicia tell of him
who is destined to drown, that for a moment, during the most
tremendous storms, he is permitted to behold the island of
Cyprus, realm of the Goddess of Love. Around boil whirlwinds
and whirlpools, and the voices of the waters; and great
in number are the navigators who, attracted by the splendour
of that island, have lost ships upon its rocks. Many a gallant
bark has there been dashed to pieces, many sunk for ever in
the deep! Yonder on the coast lie piteous hulks, overgrown
with seaweed, half buried by sand. Of one the prow juts
exposed; of another the stern; of another the gaping beams
of its side, like the blackened ribs of a corpse. So many
are they, that there it looks like the Resurrection Day, when the
Sea shall give up its dead! But over the isle itself is a curtain
of eternal azure, and the sun shines on flowery hills. And the
stillness of the air is such, that when the priest swings the
censer on the temple steps, the flame ascends to heaven
straight, unwavering as the white columns and the giant
cypresses mirrored in an untroubled lake lying inland, far
from the shore. Only the streams that flow from that lake, and
cascades leaping from one porphyry basin to another, trouble
the solitude with their pleasant sound. Those drowning far
at sea hear for a moment that soft murmur, and see the still
lake of sweet waters, and the wind carries to them the perfume
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
of myrtle and rose. Ever the more terrible the outer
tempest, the profounder that calm in the island realm of the
Cyprian.'
</p><p>
He ceased: the strains of lute and viol died away, and
that silence followed which is sweeter than any music. As
if lulled by the words just spoken, as if caught away from
actual life by the long hush, a stranger to all things except
the will of the artist, Monna Lisa, like calm and pure and
fathomless water, looked into Leonardo's eyes with that mystic
smile which was the very counterpart of his own. Giovanni
Boltraffio, watching now one, now the other, thought of two
mirrors, each reflecting, absorbing the other into infinity.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Next morning Leonardo was working in the Palazzo
Vecchio at his 'Battle of Anghiari.'
</p><p>
In 1503, when he had come from Rome, he had received
an order from Piero Soderini, then the supreme authority in
the republic, to paint some memorable battle on the wall of
the new council-chamber. He chose the famous Florentine
victory of 1440, over Niccolò Piccinino, the general of Filippo
Visconti, Duke of Lombardy.
</p><p>
A portion of the picture was already completed: four horsemen
struggling for possession of a standard&mdash;little more than
a rag fluttering on a staff, its pole snapped and about to be
shivered into pieces. Five hands have seized the shaft, and
are pulling furiously in contrary directions. Sabres cross in
the air; mouths are opened in a horrific yell. The distorted
human faces are not less hideous than the jowls of the
monstrous creatures on their helmets. The horses have been
infected with the fury of their riders, and are rearing and
striking each other with their forelegs, their ears laid back,
their eyeballs rolling and glaring, as they gnash their teeth
and bite like tigers. Below, in a pool of blood, one man is
killing another, clutching his hair and dashing his head
against the ground, not noticing that in a moment they will
both alike be trampled down by the advancing hoofs.
</p><p>
This was war in all its horror, the supreme folly of humanity,
the 'most bestial of madnesses,' according to Leonardo's own
expression, 'which leaves no footprint unfilled with blood.'
</p><p>
This morning the painter had scarcely taken his work in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
hand when he heard steps upon the brick floor; he recognised
them, and frowned without looking up. It was Piero Soderini,
the <i>Gonfaloniere</i>.
</p><p>
Soderini required a precise account of every <i>soldo</i> advanced
by the treasury for the purchase of wood, lac, chalk, paints,
linseed oil, and other trifles. Never, when in the service of
'tyrants,' as the <i>Gonfaloniere</i> contemptuously called them, at
the courts of Ludovico Sforza, or of Cæsar Borgia, had Leonardo
been subjected to such petty interferences as here in the
service of the free republic, in the region of civil equality.
</p><p>
'For what had you hoped?' asked the painter with a
certain curiosity.
</p><p>
'We had hoped that your work would immortalise the warlike
renown of the republic, and show the memorable exploits
of our heroes; had hoped for something to elevate the soul,
to give a noble example of patriotism. I grant you that war
is as you have shown it; but, I ask you, Messer Leonardo,
why not ennoble and adorn it, and modify its extremes? for
the great thing is "moderation in all things!" I may be mistaken,
but to my thinking the painter's true business is to
benefit the people by instructing them.'
</p><p>
He had now touched on his favourite theme, and with
brightened eyes he talked on; his monotonous voice had the
ceaseless trickle of water, wearing away a stone. The painter
scarcely replied; though, curious to know what this worthy
citizen really thought on the subject of art, he listened at
intervals with some attention. He felt as if he had gone into
a dark and narrow room, crowded with people, and with an
absolutely stifling atmosphere.
</p><p>
'Art which has no profit for the people,' said Messer Piero,
'is merely an amusement for the rich, a distraction for the
idle, a luxury for tyrants. You agree, my good sir?'
</p><p>
'Certainly,' assented Leonardo, and he continued, sarcastic
purpose scarce visible in the twinkle of his eyes. 'Permit
me, sir, to suggest a practical method of terminating our
perennial debate. Let the citizens of the Florentine Republic
assemble in this very chamber, and take a vote on the
question whether or no my picture be moral&mdash;that is,
popular. There would be great advantage in this course.
The question would be settled with mathematical certainty
by counting heads; for the voice of the people is, as you
are aware, the voice of God.'
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
Soderini weighed the suggestion. He was so impressed
by the virtue of the black and white balls used for voting,
that it never occurred to him a mock could be made at
the mystery. Presently, however, he understood, and fixing
his eyes on the painter, stared in blank astonishment, almost
terror. Yet he quickly recovered himself. Artists are known
to be persons unreliable and devoid of common sense, and it
ill behoved him to take offence at this painter fellow's gibe.
</p><p>
Messer Piero did not pursue the subject; in the tone of a
superior addressing a dependent, he mentioned that Michelangelo
Buonarroti had received an order to paint the second
wall of the council chamber, and curtly took his leave.
Leonardo followed him with his eyes. Sleek, grey, with
crooked legs and a bent back, he seemed even more closely
than usual to resemble a rat.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>III</h3>

<p>On leaving the Palazzo Vecchio Leonardo paused in the
piazza before Michelangelo's 'David.' It stood as if on
guard, a giant of white marble, relieved against the background
of dark stone. Young, thin, naked, the veins swollen
in his right hand which held the sling, his left arm was
raised in front of his breast, the stone within the hand. His
brows were knit, his gaze far away, like one taking aim.
The curls upon his low forehead seemed already the garland
of victory. Leonardo remembered the description in the
Book of Kings; and seeing him stand there where Savonarola
had been burned, he thought of the prophet Fra Girolamo
had desired in vain, the hero for whom Machiavelli was still
waiting.
</p><p>
In this work of his rival's Leonardo recognised the expression
of a soul great as his own, but eternally opposed
to it; opposed as action is to contemplation, passion to apathy,
storm to tranquillity. This alien force attracted him; he
felt the inevitable fascination of something new, the desire to
come close to it, to study, and understand it.
</p><p>
Two years earlier, among the building stones of Santa
Maria del Fiore, lay a huge block of white marble, spoilt by
an unskilled sculptor. The best masters had refused it,
thinking it no longer good for anything. It had been offered
to Leonardo himself, and with his usual slowness he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
meditated, measured, calculated, hesitated. Then came
another, twenty-three years younger than he, who had undertaken
the task without misgiving; with incredible rapidity,
working by night as well as by day, he had made this giant
in two years and one month. Leonardo had worked for six
years at the clay of his Colossus; he dared not think how
long he would have required for a marble statue like this
David.
</p><p>
The Florentines had proclaimed Michelangelo Leonardo's
rival in the art of sculpture, and the young man had not
hesitated to accept his challenge. Now it seemed he was
about to place himself in competition with the older master
as a painter also. He had yet hardly taken a brush in his
hand, but with a daring which might seem presumption, he
was about to paint the second war-picture in the council
chamber.
</p><p>
Leonardo had met his youthful rival with goodwill and
every consideration; but Michelangelo hated him with all
the fire of his impetuous nature. Leonardo's calm he fancied
contempt: he listened to calumnies, he sought pretexts for
quarrels, he seized every occasion to damage his rival. When
the 'David' was finished the best painters and sculptors were
invited by the Signoria to discuss where it should be placed.
Leonardo agreed with Giuliano da San Gallo, the architect,
that the most suitable position would be under the Loggia
de' Priori, and not, as others suggested, in front of the Palazzo
della Signoria. Michelangelo swore that Leonardo, prompted
by envy, wished his rival's work hidden in a corner where no
one could properly see it.
</p><p>
Discussions on abstract questions were at this time much
the vogue, and on one occasion a company, including the
brothers Pollaiuoli, the aged Botticelli, Filippino Lippi, and
Lorenzo di Credi, assembled in Leonardo's studio to debate
whether sculpture or painting held the higher place among
the arts. Leonardo quickly, with a whimsical expression,
gave his opinion thus:&mdash;
</p><p>
'The further art is removed from a handicraft the nearer
it approaches perfection. The major distinction between
the two arts lies in the fact that painting demands greater
effort of mind, sculpture greater effort of body. The shape,
contained like a kernel in the block of marble, is slowly set
free by the sculptor's blows of chisel and mallet, needing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
the exertion of all his bodily powers. Great fatigue ensues,
the labourer is drenched with sweat, which mingling with
dust becomes a miry crust upon his garments; his face is
smeared and covered with white like a baker's, his studio
is filled with chips. Whereas the painter, perfectly calm, in
elegant habiliments, seated at ease in his chair, plies a light
brush and manipulates pleasant paints. His house is clean,
and quiet, so that his toil can be sweetened by converse, or
music, or reading, undisturbed by hammerings or scrapings.'
</p><p>
These words came to the ears of Michelangelo, who
imagined them aimed at himself. He took occasion to make
venomous reply:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Let this Messer da Vinci, a kitchen-wench's bastard, be
ashamed of dirty work; I, the heir of an old and honourable
house, despise neither sweat nor mire. The dispute is foolish,
for all the arts are equal, proceeding from one source, aiming
at one goal. He who maintains that painting is nobler than
sculpture knows no more of either than my serving-maid.'
</p><p>
He set to work with feverish energy on his picture for the
council chamber, wishing to overtake his rival&mdash;a feat by no
means difficult. His subject was an incident in the Pisan
campaign: a sudden attack by the enemy while the soldiers
were bathing. The men hurry to the bank, scramble out of
the pleasant waves, draw on their sweated and dusty clothes,
don their cuirasses and helmets, which are burning hot under
the fiery sunshine. Michelangelo thus showed war as a
contrast to Leonardo's representation: not as 'the most
bestial of madnesses,' but as the performance of hard and
manful duty to the denial of ease and pleasure; as the struggle
of heroes for the greatness and glory of their country.
</p><p>
The Florentines watched the growth of the two pictures
and the rivalry between the artists with all the keenness of
spectators at a raree show; and as strife unconnected with
politics seemed to them tasteless as broth without salt, they
affirmed that Michelangelo was for the republic against the
Medici, Leonardo for the Medici against the republic. The
artistic duel now became intelligible to everybody; the town
was divided into two parties; and men, to whom art was a
sealed book, declared themselves the adherents of one or
other of the two artists whose works had become the ensigns
of hostile camps. Stones were thrown secretly at the 'David';
the rich accused the poor of this outrage, the demagogues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
accused the substantial burghers; the artists, the pupils;
and Buonarroti, in the presence of the <i>Gonfaloniere</i>, asserted
that ruffians had been hired by Leonardo to damage his
statue.
</p><p>
One day Leonardo, working at his portrait in the presence
of Boltraffio and Salaino, said to Monna Lisa:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Could I but come to speech with Messer Michelangelo,
face to face, as I speak with you, madonna, all would
be explained, and no trace would remain of this stupid quarrel.
He would learn that I am not his enemy, and that there is
no man living could love him better than I.'
</p><p>
Madonna Lisa shook her head.
</p><p>
'Nay, Messer Leonardo, he would not understand you.'
</p><p>
'Such a man could not fail to understand. The mischief
is that he is diffident and has too little self-confidence. He
fears and tortures himself and is jealous, because he does not
yet know his own strength. It is folly in him. I would
reassure him. What has he to fear in me? I have seen his
sketch for the 'Soldiers bathing' and, believe me, madonna,
I was astounded, and could scarce believe my own eyes. No
one can conceive the value of this young man, nor what
he will rise to. Even now he is not only my equal, but
stronger than I. Deny it not, madonna, for I speak what I
know to be true: he is my superior.'
</p><p>
She smiled, reflecting his expression like an image in a
mirror.
</p><p>
One day in Santa Maria del Carmine, in the Cappella
Brancacci, where were the famous frescoes of Tomaso
Masaccio, the school of all the great masters, he saw a lad,
scarcely more than a boy, studying and copying as he had
done himself in his youth. He wore a paint-stained old
black frock, clean but coarse and homespun linen. He was
tall and willowy, with a slight neck, very white and long,
delicate as a girl's. His face was oval, clear cut, and
pale, with a somewhat sensuous beauty, and great dark eyes
like those of the Umbrian peasant women from whom
Perugino painted his Madonnas, eyes with no depth of
thought, deep and void as the sky. Leonardo saw the youth
a second time in the Sala del Papa at Santa Maria Novella,
where his own cartoon for the 'Battle of Anghiari' was
exhibited. This the lad was studying and copying with
no less care than he had bestowed on Masaccio's frescoes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
He evidently knew Leonardo by sight, but did not venture
to speak to him.
</p><p>
The Master addressed him; and then hurriedly, excitedly,
and with many blushes, half-presumptuous yet childishly artless,
the boy confessed that he looked on Leonardo as his
master, as the greatest of all Italian masters, whose shoe's-latchet
Michelangelo Buonarroti was not worthy to unloose.
</p><p>
Leonardo examined his drawings, and after further converse,
on other occasions, became convinced that here was a
great master of the future.
</p><p>
Sensitive and responsive as an echo to all voices, submissive
to influence as a woman, he at present imitated both
Perugino and Pinturicchio (with whom he had recently been
working in the library at Siena), and also Leonardo; but
under this immaturity the latter found a freshness of feeling
in him superior to any he had met. And the lad seemed to
have already fathomed by guesswork the deepest mysteries of
art and life; had surmounted the greatest obstacles as if
involuntarily, lightly, by chance, almost in play. Every gift
seemed to have been bestowed on him freely; he knew no
searchings of heart, no weary toil, no hesitation, no despairing
efforts, no hopeless puzzles, such as had always been to
Leonardo an incubus and a curse. And when the Master
spoke to him of the need for patient study of nature, and of
the laws of painting, the youth fixed on him soft wondering
eyes, and, it was evident, listened merely out of reverence for
the great man's opinion.
</p><p>
One day he made an observation which surprised Leonardo
by its depth:&mdash;
</p><p>
'I have noticed,' he said, 'that while one is painting one
should not think. Everything then turns out better.'
</p><p>
It seemed as if this youth's whole being was a proof that
the perfect harmony of reason and feeling, of love and
science, which the Master sought so ardently, did not, nor
could not exist. And in face of the modest and careless
frankness which shone in those unanxious eyes, Leonardo felt
greater doubt of the work of his own whole life, greater
doubt of the future destiny of art, than had ever tormented
him when confronted by the rivalry and scorn of Michelangelo.
</p><p>
At one of their first meetings Leonardo had asked the lad
his name, parentage and native place.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
'I come from Urbino,' he replied; 'my father is Giovanni
Sanzio the painter, and my name, Raphael.'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The evening before Leonardo's departure from Florence to
mend a dam which had burst on the river Arno, he was
returning from a visit to Machiavelli, who had alarmed him
by his admissions with regard to Soderini.
</p><p>
He was crossing the bridge of the Santa Trinità, towards
the Via Tornabuoni. The hour was late, and few people
were about; after a hot day a shower had freshened the
air. From the river came the sharp perfume which water
acquires in the warmth of summer; the moon was rising
behind the dark hill of San Miniato. On the bank near the
Ponte Vecchio a cluster of very ancient houses, with uneven
balconies and wooden supports, were reflected in the dull
green water. Behind Monte Albano glittered a single star.
The outline of Florence was cut against the clear sky like a
golden capital letter in some ancient manuscript; an outline
unique in the world, familiar to Leonardo as the outline of a
human face. To the north rose the ancient belfry of Santa
Croce, near it the straight slender stem of the tower of the
Palazzo Vecchio; then Giotto's marble campanile, and the
red cupola of Santa Maria del Fiore, like the gigantic expanding
blossom of the purple lily, the flower of Florence on her
standards and escutcheons. All Florence, bathed in moonlight
seemed a huge silver flower.
</p><p>
Leonardo noted that every city has its own especial
perfume; that of Florence was a mingling of the scent of
iris flowers, and the faint odour of dust and damp and old
varnish which belongs to ancient pictures.
</p><p>
His thoughts veered to her who was becoming their constant
preoccupation&mdash;Monna Lisa Gioconda. He knew scarce
more of her life than did Giovanni his pupil; it was less
an annoyance than a perpetual astonishment to him to
reflect that she had a husband&mdash;Messer Francesco, so tall
and lean, with a wart on his cheek, thick eyebrows; a
positive soul; whose talk was of Sicilian cattle and the tax
upon sheepskins. There were moments in which Leonardo
rejoiced in her ethereal charm, which seemed above common
humanity, yet was more real to him than aught belonging to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
everyday life. There were other moments in which he acutely
felt the beauty of the living woman.
</p><p>
Lisa was not one of those celebrated by the poetasters as
<i>dotte eroine</i> (learned heroines). She never displayed her
knowledge of books; only by chance he found out that
she read both Latin and Greek. She spoke so simply that
many imagined her stupid. But Leonardo found in her
what is most rare, especially among women, instinctive
wisdom. Sometimes by a chance sentence she would reveal
herself so near, so akin to him in spirit, that he felt her his one
and eternal friend, the sister of his soul. At these moments
he would fain have overpassed the magic circle which divides
contemplation from life; but such desires he quenched at
once. Was this love which united them? Platonic ravings,
languid sighs of ideal lovers, syrupy sonnets in the Petrarchan
style, had never excited in him anything but amusement or
boredom. Equally alien to his nature was the passion which
most men call love. Just as he ate no meat, because it
seemed to him repulsive, so he refrained from women,
because all material possession&mdash;in marriage or outside it&mdash;seemed
to him coarse. He avoided it as he avoided
the shambles, neither blaming nor approving, acknowledging
the law of natural struggle for hunger or for love, but refusing
to take any part in it himself, and obeying a purer law of
chastity and love.
</p><p>
Yet even if he had loved her, what more perfect union
with the beloved could he have wished than in this secret
and mystic intercourse, in the creation of this immortal
image, this new being, born of them both, as a child of
its parents, in which he and she were one? Nevertheless
he felt that even in this mystic union, stainless as it
was, there was danger&mdash;it might be greater danger than
in the bond of ordinary fleshly love. They walked on the
verge of a precipice where none had walked before, resisting
the vertigo and the fatal attraction of the abyss. Between
them were simple words, vague and uncompleted phrases,
through which their secret showed as the sun shines through
the morning mist. At times he thought, What if the mist
should scatter, and the blinding sun shine out which kills
mystery, dissolves all phantoms? What if he or she should
prove unequal to the strain, should overstep the magic circle,
materialise imagination into fact, contemplation into life?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
Had he the right to test a human soul, the soul of his life-long
friend, his spiritual sister, as he tested the laws of mechanics,
the structure of plants, the action of poisons? Would she
not revolt, cast him from her with contempt and hatred?
</p><p>
Again at times he fancied he was subjecting her to a slow
and a terrible death. Her submissiveness alarmed him; it
seemed limitless, like his own eternal search for knowledge,
the delicate yet penetrating scrutiny to which he subjected
her. Sooner or later he would have to decide what she was
to him, a woman or a spirit. He had been hoping that
temporary absence would postpone this inevitable decision,
and for this reason was glad to be leaving Florence.
</p><p>
But now that the moment had come, that separation was
imminent, he realised that he had been mistaken, and that
instead of deferring, his departure must hasten the decision.
</p><p>
Absorbed in these thoughts, he did not notice that he had
wandered into a lonely blind alley, and on looking about him
did not at once recognise where he was. Giotto's campanile
appearing above the houses showed he was in the vicinity of the
cathedral. One side of the narrow street was lost in blackest
shadow, the other was white under the rays of the moon. A
distant light glowed red. It came from one of the <i>loggie</i>
characteristic of Florence, with a balcony and semi-circular
arches on slender pillars; a company in masks and cloaks
were singing a serenade, to the gentle tinkling of a lute.
</p><p>
It was the old love-song, composed by Lorenzo Il
Magnifico, which had once sounded in the carnival procession;
a melancholy yet joyous melody, pleasant to Leonardo's
ears because he had know it in his youth.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">Quanto è bella giovinezza!</p>
<p class="i4">Ma sen fugge tuttavia</p>
<p class="i4">Chi vuol esser lieto sia</p>
<p class="i4">Di doman non v'è certezza.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>(Fair-fleeting Youth must snatch at happiness:</p>
<p>He knows not if to-morrow curse or bless.)</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The last line lingered sadly in his ears with mournful foreboding.
</p><p>
Already on the threshold of old age, and approaching
darkness and solitude, had not Fate sent him at last a
living soul, a kindred soul? Must he repulse it? must
he deny it? sacrifice life for contemplation, as he had so
often done before? renounce the near for the faraway, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
real for the ideal? Which was he to choose, the true and
living and mortal Gioconda or the immortal, which had no
material existence? They were equally dear to him, yet he
must choose between them; choose at once, for her sake.
But his will was weak. He could arrive at no decision, and
wandered on aimlessly through the streets, debating, debating
with himself.
</p><p>
Presently he reached the house of Piero Martelli, where he
lodged. The doors were shut, the lights extinguished. He
raised the hammer hung on a chain, and knocked. The
porter did not come. Repeated blows were only answered
by echoes from the sounding arches of the stone staircase.
Echoes died away and silence succeeded, seeming the more
profound for the brightness of the moonlight.
</p><p>
A clock boomed from a neighbouring tower. The heavy
measured clanging told of the silent and dreadful flight of
time, of the darkness and loneliness of age, of the past
which could never return. And long did the last clang
vibrate in the moonlit stillness, quivering on the air, now
weakening, now strengthening again in ever widening waves
of sound, as if repeating&mdash;</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>The next day, at her habitual hour, Monna Lisa came to
the studio for the first time unaccompanied. She knew it was
their last interview. It was a brilliant morning, and Leonardo
lowered the canvas curtain to produce that dim and tender
light, transparent as submarine shadows, which gave her face
its greatest charm.
</p><p>
They were alone.
</p><p>
He kept working on in silence, calm and absorbed, forgetting
his thoughts of the previous night, forgetting the parting,
the inevitable choice. Past and Future had alike vanished
from his memory; time had come to a standstill; it seemed
as if she had always sat, and would ever thus sit before him,
with that calm strange smile. What he could not do in life
he did by imagination; he blended the two images in one&mdash;mingled
the reality and its reflection&mdash;the living woman and
the immortal.
</p><p>
He had now the sense of a great deliverance. He no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
longer either pitied her or feared her. He knew her submissiveness,
that she would accept all, endure all; die, perhaps,
but never revolt. And momently he looked at her with that
curiosity which had taken him to the execution of the condemned,
that he might watch the last shudders of fear on the
dying faces.
</p><p>
Suddenly he fancied that a strange shadow, as of an unbidden
thought, which he had not evoked, which he wished
away, appeared upon her countenance, like the cloud of
human breath upon the surface of a mirror. To preserve her,
to recall her anew to the Type, within the fatidic circle, to
banish from her this human shadow, he related gravely, like
a magician pronouncing an incantation, one of his mystic
tales.
</p><p>
'Unable to resist the desire of beholding new forms, the
secret creations of nature, I at length reached the cavern,
and there at the entrance stood still in terror. I stooped,
the left hand on the right knee, and shading my eyes with my
hand to accustom myself to the darkness, I presently took
heart and entered, and moved forward for several steps.
Then, frowning, straining my sight to the utmost, I unwittingly
changed my course and wandered hither and thither in
the darkness, feeling my way and groping after the definite.
But the obscurity was overpowering, and when I had passed
some time in it, Fear and Curiosity contended most mightily
within me: fear of searching that dark cavern, and curiosity
after its secret.'
</p><p>
He was silent. The unwonted shadow lay still upon her
face.
</p><p>
'Which of the two feelings gained the day?' La Gioconda
murmured.
</p><p>
'Curiosity.'
</p><p>
'And you learned the stupendous secret?'
</p><p>
'I learned ... what could be learned.'
</p><p>
'And will reveal it to men?'
</p><p>
'I would not, nor could not, reveal all. But I would
inspire them also with curiosity strong enough to vanquish
fear.'
</p><p>
'<i>And if curiosity be not enough</i>, Messer Leonardo?' she
said slowly, an unwonted fire in her eyes; 'if something
further, a profounder feeling, were needed to lay bare the
cavern's last and greatest treasure?'
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
And she turned toward him a smile he had never seen
before.
</p><p>
'What more is needed?' he asked.
</p><p>
She was silent. Just then a slender blinding ray shone
through a rent in the curtain; the dimness vanished; the
mystery, the clear shadows, tender as distant music, fled.
</p><p>
'You leave to-morrow?' she said suddenly.
</p><p>
'No. To-night.'
</p><p>
'I, too, am soon departing.'
</p><p>
The artist looked at her steadily, attempted speech, and
said nothing. He devined her meaning; that she would not
stay in Florence without him.
</p><p>
'Messer Francesco,' she continued, 'goes presently for
three months to Calabria. I have asked him to take me
with him.'
</p><p>
He frowned. This sunshine was not to his mind; the
fountain had been ghostly white; now it had taken the rainbow
hues of life. Leonardo felt that he was returning to life,
timid, weak, pitiable.
</p><p>
'No matter,' said Monna Lisa, 'draw closer the curtain.
It is early yet. I am not tired.'
</p><p>
'I have painted enough,' he said, throwing down his brush.
</p><p>
'You will not finish my portrait?'
</p><p>
'Why not?' he cried hastily, as if alarmed. 'Will you not
come to me when you return?'
</p><p>
'I will come. But shall I be the same? You have told
me that faces, especially the faces of women, quickly change.'
</p><p>
'I long to finish it. But sometimes to me it seems
impossible?'
</p><p>
'Impossible?' wondered La Gioconda. 'Ay, they tell me you
finish nothing because you are always seeking the impossible.'
</p><p>
In these words he fancied a tender reproach.
</p><p>
'The moment has come!' he thought.
</p><p>
She rose and said with her usual calm:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Farewell, Messer Leonardo. I wish you a good journey.'
He also had risen, and looking at her he saw again helpless
entreaty and reproach on her face. He knew that this
moment was irrevocable for both&mdash;final and solemn as death.
He felt he must break this pregnant silence, yet no words came
to him. The more he forced his will to find a solution, the
more he was conscious of his own powerlessness and the
profundity of the abyss which must divide them. Monna
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
Lisa still smiled her quiet smile; that calmness, that brightness,
seemed to him now the smile of the dead. Intolerable
pity filled his heart and weakened him still more.
</p><p>
She stretched out her hand; he took it and kissed it for
the first time since he had known her. As he did so she
bent quickly, and he felt that La Gioconda touched his hair
with her lips.
</p><p>
'May God have you in his keeping,' she said simply.
</p><p>
When he recovered from his wonder&mdash;she was gone.
Around him was the dead silence of a summer afternoon,
more menacing than midnight. Again he heard the heavy
measured clanging of the clock, telling of the irremediable
flight of time, of the darkness and loneliness of age, of the
past, which can return no more. And as the last vibrations
died away the words of the plaintive love song echoed in his
ears:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Di doman non v'è certezza.'</p>
<p>'<i>And count not on the day to come.</i>'</p>
</div></div></div>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Learning that Messer Giocondo was not returning from
Calabria till October, Leonardo deferred his return to Florence
for ten days that he might not reach the city till Madonna
Lisa was there. He counted the hours till that moment
should arrive; superstitious dread oppressed his heart when
he remembered that accident might easily prolong the separation.
He strove not to think; he asked no one for news lest
he should hear something disappointing.
</p><p>
At last the day came, and he reached Florence early in the
morning. Autumnal, damp and dull, the city yet seemed
especially fair. It spoke to him of La Gioconda. It was one
of <i>her</i> days; misty, transparent, with subdued light, as of
sunlight seen through water.
</p><p>
He no longer asked himself how they would meet, what he
should say, nor how he must act that they might part no
more, that he might keep her for ever as his only friend, the
sister of his soul.
</p><p>
'Things turn out best when one does not think too much.
The great thing is, not to think,' he said to himself, quoting the
lad Raphael. 'I will question her; and she will tell me all
which that day we left unsaid; she will explain what more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
than curiosity is necessary if one is to discover the marvel of
the cavern.'
</p><p>
Gladness filled his soul as if he were a boy of sixteen with
his life before him; yet deep down under this gladness there
lingered a half unconscious presentiment of mishap.
</p><p>
In the evening he visited Machiavelli, intending to go to
Messer Giocondo's house next day. Impatience, however,
overcame him, and he decided to call at once and ask for
news from the porter of Madonna Lisa's safe arrival. He
went down the Via Tornabuoni towards the Ponte Santa
Trinità, the same route, though in the opposite direction,
which he had followed the night before his departure. The
weather had suddenly changed, as often happens in Florence
on autumn evenings. The north wind, piercing as a knife,
blew down the valley of the Mugnone, and the crest of the
Mugello was whitened with snow. In the town it was raining;
but just above the horizon there remained a narrow strip of
clear sky, and from it the sun suddenly burst forth, flooding
the wet streets and shining roofs and the faces of the passers-by
with a harsh yellow light. The rain seemed like copper
dust, and the glass of distant windows glowed like live coals.
</p><p>
Near the bridge and opposite the church of Santa Trinità,
in the angle formed by the river bank and the Via Tornabuoni,
rose the imposing Palazzo degli Spini, built of large warm-grey
stones, with barred lancet windows and castellated roof
like a fortress. Down below was the customary row of stone
benches, where the citizens congregated to tell the news, to
sun or to shade themselves, to play at dice or draughts.
There was a loggia at the other side of the palace, looking out
upon the Arno.
</p><p>
As he passed, Leonardo saw in this loggia a group of persons,
strangers to him for the most part, disputing so
vehemently that they did not notice the storm.
</p><p>
'Messer Leonardo! come hither and resolve our question!'
they called to him. He stopped. The dispute was
about certain lines in the thirty-fourth canto of Dante's
<i>Inferno</i>, where Lucifer is described buried breast-high in the
ice at the very bottom of the accursed Pit.
</p><p>
The matter was expounded to Leonardo by one of the
disputants, a rich old wool merchant. The artist, however,
was but half attending, for his eyes were fixed on a man
coming along the Lungarno Acciaioli. This person walked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
heavily, shambling like a bear: he was bent and bony, with
a large head, black hair, and ill-shaped beard; his clothes
were poor and carelessly thrown on. He had a broad-browed
heavy face, with projecting ears and a broken nose. His
small eyes dilated and glowed strangely under excitement, and
much night-work had reddened his eyelids. Indeed he was
said to work preferably in underground darkness, with a
small round lamp attached to his forehead, like a new Cyclops.
It was Michelangelo.
</p><p>
'Give us your opinion,' urged the disputants of Leonardo.
</p><p>
'I have heard,' replied the painter, 'that Messer Buonarroti
is a student of the great Alighieri. Ask him; he will answer
your question better than I.'
</p><p>
For Leonardo had always hoped that his difference with
Michelangelo would die a natural death; and he was anxious
for an occasion which would bring them to speech together.
</p><p>
The younger man, hearing his name pronounced, stopped
and raised his eyes. He was reserved and shy, even to wildness,
dreading the stare of strangers, and fancying that they
scorned his ugliness, which he himself was never able to forget.
Now he looked suspiciously at the company in the
loggia; but when he saw Leonardo's smile, and his piercing
glance bent down upon him, for the older man was much the
taller of the two, shyness changed into rage. He grew
pale and red by turns; words choked him; but at last
he blurted out:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Explain it yourself, most intelligent of sages, sold to the
Lombards! Books are your proper pastime; you who spent
sixteen years trying to hatch a clay horse, and when you tried
to cast it in bronze threw up the task in despair.' He knew
he was speaking outrageously; but such was his fury that no
words seemed to him sufficiently insulting to hurl at his rival.
</p><p>
Leonardo made no reply; he looked the other full in the
face, and the bystanders also were silent, watching the two
men.
</p><p>
Before the violence of Buonarroti, Leonardo's calm almost
feminine smile, tinged with sadness, suggested weakness. But
he himself remembered Monna Lisa's words, that Michelangelo
would never pardon him for his gift of that quietness
which is mightier than storm.
</p><p>
Michelangelo finding no more words waved his hand,
turned quickly, and went on his way, with his shambling gait,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
his dull unconscious habit of growling, his bent head and
bowed shoulders, upon which seemed to rest some superhuman
burden. Soon he disappeared as if dissolved into the turbid
copper-coloured rain and the wild and threatening sunlight.
</p><p>
Leonardo walked on. On the bridge one of the company
in the loggia of the Palazzo Spini overtook him&mdash;a little man
with the aspect of a Jew, though a pure-blooded Florentine,
known to Leonardo as a scandal-monger. The painter
crossed the bridge, the other running by his side, talking
of Michelangelo, and trying to force Leonardo into some
adverse criticism of his rival, which no doubt he intended
to repeat at the earliest opportunity. Leonardo, however,
refused to be drawn into this trap, and remained silent.
</p><p>
The intruder was not to be shaken off.
</p><p>
'Tell me, Messere,' he said, 'have you yet finished your
portrait of La Gioconda?'
</p><p>
'I have not,' answered the painter. 'Why are you interested?'
</p><p>
'Nay, I was only considering the matter. For three years
you have laboured at one picture, and you say it is still
incomplete. But to us ignorant amateurs it seems already
perfection, and we can conceive of nothing further to be
done.'
</p><p>
And he smiled obsequiously. Leonardo would have liked
to take the little man by the collar and fling him into the
river.
</p><p>
'And what will you do now?' continued the irrepressible
one. 'But perhaps you have not heard, Messer Leonardo?'
</p><p>
Through his aversion the artist felt a spasm of dread. The
other had evidently something on his tongue; his eyes
danced, his hands shook. He seemed like some noxious
insect.
</p><p>
'Oh, <i>Santo Iddio benedetto</i>!' he exclaimed; 'forsooth you
only returned to Florence this morning, so the news may not
have reached you. Poor Messer Giocondo! to be thrice
widowed! Conceive what bad luck! 'Tis now a month
since Madonna Lisa, by the will of Heaven, expired!'
</p><p>
Darkness fell upon Leonardo's eyes; for a moment it
seemed to him he must swoon. But the keen inquisitive
gaze of his tormentor helped him to a superhuman effort of
self-control; he turned pale, but his face remained inscrutable.
The other, disappointed, presently took his leave. Left alone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
Leonardo gradually recovered his composure. His first
thought was that the busybody had lied; inventing the evil
tidings on purpose to see what effect they would produce on
the artist whose name had long been whispered as a lover of
La Gioconda's. It was incredible that she could really be
dead.
</p><p>
Before nightfall, however, he had learned all. Madonna
Lisa, victim, said some, of a contagious malady of the throat,
had died at the obscure town of Lagonero, on the return
journey from Calabria to Florence.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The attempt to divert the Arno from Pisa ended in disaster.
Floods destroyed the works, and turned the blooming lowland
into a pestilential swamp, where the workmen died of
malaria. The labour, the money, the lives had been
expended for naught: the Ferrarese engineers threw the
blame upon Soderini, Machiavelli, and Leonardo. They
were placed under a ban, and their acquaintances turned
from them in the streets. Niccolò fell ill of vexation.
</p><p>
Two years before this, Leonardo's father, Ser Piero da
Vinci, notary of the palace of the Podestà, had died at the
age of eighty.
</p><p>
In the matter of inheritance Ser Piero had frequently
expressed an intention of placing Leonardo on an equal footing
with his legitimate sons. They refused to execute his
will. Leonardo's affairs were at this time much involved,
and he was induced to assent to the proposal of one of the
Hebrew usurers, from whom he had borrowed on the security
of his expectations, that he should sell him his claim on the
paternal inheritance. A lawsuit followed which lasted for
six years. Taking advantage of Leonardo's unpopularity, his
brothers poured oil on the flames, accusing him of sorcery,
atheism, high treason during his service with Cæsar Borgia, and
violation of tombs by digging up corpses for dissection; they
even insulted the memory of his dead mother, Caterina, and
revived the twenty-year-old slander, accusing him of vice.
</p><p>
In addition to all these trials was added the failure of the
picture in the Council Chamber. Notwithstanding his
experience with regard to the <i>Cenacolo</i>, he had used oil
paints also for the 'Battle of Anghiari,' though with what he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
believed an improved method. When the work was half
finished he attempted to hasten the fixing of the paint in the
plaster by means of a great fire in a brazier before the picture.
But the heat acted only on the lower part of the surface; the
varnish and paint higher up would not dry.
</p><p>
After many fruitless experiments he realised that the second
attempt at wall-painting in oil was unsuccessful as the first,
and that the 'Battle' would fade away as surely as the 'Last
Supper.'
</p><p>
Once more, in Michelangelo's words, he was obliged to
throw up his task in despair.
</p><p>
The picture troubled him more than the Pisan canal
or the fraternal lawsuit. Soderini had harassed him with
demands for mercantile exactness in the carrying out of the
order for the fresco, pressed for completion within a given
time, threatened him with penalties, finally accused him openly
of having misappropriated public money. Yet when Leonardo,
having borrowed from his friends, proposed to restore all he
had received from the treasury, Messer Piero refused to
accept his offer, and meanwhile was not ashamed to write to
the Seigneur Charles d'Amboise, governor of Lombardy, who
was negotiating for the transfer of the painter from Florence
to Milan:&mdash;
</p><p>
'The conduct of Leonardo da Vinci has not been honourable:
for having received a large sum for the execution of
a great work, he abandoned it when he had completed but a
very little, and in this matter had acted as a traitor to the
republic.'
</p><p>
One winter night Leonardo sat alone in his working room.
The wind howled in the chimney, the walls shook, the candle
flickered, the stuffed bird, suspended from a wooden bar,
swayed as if attempting to fly; above the bookshelf the
familiar spider ran in alarm about his web. Drops of rain
battered the window like the knocks of one wishing to enter.
</p><p>
After a day spent in working for his livelihood, Leonardo
felt exhausted, as by a night of fever. He tried to employ
himself by scientific study, by drawing a caricature, by
reading; but everything fell from his hands. He had no
inclination to sleep, and the whole night was before him.
</p><p>
He looked at the piles of books, at the crucibles, the
retorts, the bottles containing monstrosities preserved in spirit;
at the brass quadrants, the globes, the apparatus for the study
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
of mechanics, astronomy, physics, hydraulics, optics, and
anatomy. An unwonted repugnance to them all filled his
soul. Was not he the fellow of yonder old spider in the
dark corner above the mouldy books, the human bones, the
limbs of lifeless machines? What was left to him, what lay
between him and death, between him and utter oblivion
except certain sheets of paper, which he was covering with
writing that no one could read? And he remembered his
happiness when as a child he had climbed the heights of
Monte Albano, had seen the flocks of cranes, had smelt the
freshness of spring, had gazed at the fair city of Florence,
lying in the sunlight haze like an amethyst, so small that it
could be framed between two branches of juniper. Yes, he
had been happy; thinking of nothing, knowing nothing.
</p><p>
Was the whole labour of his life a mockery? Was Love,
after all, <i>not</i> the daughter of Knowledge?
</p><p>
He listened to the howling, the shrieking, the roaring of
the storm, and he remembered Machiavelli's words: 'The
most fearful thing in life is not poverty nor care, sickness
nor sorrow, nor death itself. It is weariness of spirit.'
</p><p>
And still the inhuman voice of the night wind spoke of
things unavoidable yet unintelligible to the mind of man; of
the loneliness, the blackness of utter darkness on the bosom
of old Chaos, mother of all that is; of the boundless
weariness of the spirit of the world. Leonardo rose, took
a candle, went into the next room, uncovered a picture
standing on an easel and veiled with a heavy drapery like
a shroud. It was the portrait of Monna Lisa Gioconda.
</p><p>
He had not looked at it since their parting. Now it
seemed that he saw it for the first time; such vigour of life
was in it that he trembled before his own creation. He
remembered old-world traditions of magic portraits which, if
pierced by a needle, caused the death of the living originals.
In this case had he not done the contrary, taken life from
the living woman to give it to the dead?
</p><p>
It was all vivid and exact, to the last fold of her dress, to
the little stars of the delicate embroidery garnishing the
opening round her neck. It seemed as if the white bosom
heaved, the blood beat warm in the arteries, the expression
of the face changed. Yet was she spectral, far off, alien;
more antique, in her deathless youth, than the cliffs in the
picture background&mdash;strange, sky-blue rocks, like stalactites,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
that seemed visions of a world long extinct Ah! and the
waves of her hair fell from under the dark transparent veil,
by the same laws of divine mechanics as fell the waves of
water in the cataract! It was only now, when he had lost
her, that he knew the charm of Monna Lisa. Hers was the
charm which he had sought in nature; the secret of the
universe was the secret of this woman, whom he had loved.
</p><p>
And it was no longer he who was putting her to the test,
but she who was trying him. What meant the gaze of those
eyes, reflecting his own soul? Was she repeating what
she had said at their last meeting&mdash;telling him that more than
curiosity is needed, if the most wondrous secret of the cavern
is to be discovered? Or was this the alien smile of perfect
knowledge with which the dead look at the living? For the
first time he realised that she was truly dead. Could he or
could he not have saved her? Never before had he looked
into the face of Death so directly, so near. Terror turned
his soul to ice. He drew back from the horror: for the
first time in his life he did not wish to <i>know</i>.
</p><p>
With a hasty and furtive movement he dropped the shroud
again over the canvas, and turned away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the succeeding spring, by the good offices of Charles
d'Amboise, Leonardo was freed from his engagements to the
Florentine Republic, and able to return to Milan. Now, as
twenty-five years before, he was glad to leave his home, and
to see the snowy crests of the Alps rising above the great
plain of Lombardy. Now, as then, he was an exile, cast out
from his country and his home.

<h3 class="p2">I</h3>

<p>In the year 1507 Leonardo definitely entered the service
of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XII</span>., established himself at Milan, and went no more
to Florence, except for small matters of business.
</p><p>
Four years passed uneventfully.
</p><p>
Towards the close of 1511 Giovanni Boltraffio, who was
now a master of repute, was working at a wall-painting in the
new Church of San Maurizio. It belonged to the ancient
foundation of the Monastero Maggiore, and was built on the
ruins of the Roman circus. Beside it, enclosed by a high
fence and abutting on the Via Della Vigna, was a neglected
garden, and the once splendid but now deserted and ruined
palace of the Counts of Carmagnola. The nuns of the
Monastero Maggiore had let this house and garden to
Messer Galeotto Sacrobosco, the old alchemist, who had
lately returned to Milan with Cassandra his niece. Their
cottage by the Porta Vercellina having been destroyed at the
time of the first French invasion, the pair had wandered for
nine years in Greece, the islands of the Archipelago, Asia
Minor, and Syria. Strange tales were told of them: Galeotto
had found the philosopher's stone; he had appropriated vast
sums lent him by the Devâtdâr of Syria for experiments, and
had fled for his life. Monna Cassandra, by the help of the
devil, had found treasure on the site of an ancient Ph&oelig;nician
temple; she had bewitched, drugged, and plundered a wealthy
merchant at Constantinople; at any rate the pair had left
Milan beggars, and had returned rich&mdash;that much was certain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
Pupil of Demetrius Chalcondylas, and also of Sidonia the
witch, Cassandra appeared now a devout daughter of the
Church. She observed all fasts and ceremonies, she attended
the holy offices, and by her charities had acquired the favour
not only of the sisters of the Monastero Maggiore, but that
of the archbishop himself. Evil tongues, however, declared
that her religion was a pretence, that she was still a pagan,
that she and her uncle had only escaped the Inquisition by
flight from Rome, and that sooner or later she was certain to
be burned at the stake. Messer Galeotto still reverenced
Leonardo, and considered him his master in the occult
wisdom of Hermes Trismegistus. The alchemist had collected
many rare books in the course of his travels; for the
most part those of Alexandrian scholars of Ptolemaic times.
Leonardo borrowed these sometimes, and generally sent
Giovanni to fetch them, since he was working close to the
alchemist's house. As had happened before, Giovanni fell
under the spell of Cassandra, and his visits became more
frequent. At first she spoke to him guardedly, acting up to
her part of repentant sinner, and expressing a desire to take
the veil. Little by little she dismissed her fears, and became
confidential. They recalled their meetings of ten years ago,
when they had both been little more than children&mdash;the lonely
terrace above the quiet Cantarana, the walls of the Convent
of St. Radegonda; especially that sultry evening when she
had spoken to him of the Resurrection of the Gods, and had
invited him to the Witches' Sabbath. Now she lived as a
recluse; was ill, or pretended to be so; and when she was
not at church she hid herself in a remote secluded dark
chamber, where the windows looked out on the neglected
garden, densely shadowed by cypress trees. The room was
furnished like a library or a museum. Here were the antiquities
she had brought from the East; fragments of statues, dog-headed
gods of black syenite from Egypt, mysterious stones
upon which was incised the magic word <i>Abraxas</i>, signifying
the three hundred and sixty-five celestial spheres of
the Gnostics; precious Byzantine parchments, which time had
rendered hard as ivory; fragments from Greek manuscripts,
hopelessly lost; earthen shards, with cuneiform Assyrian
inscriptions; books of the Persian magi, clasped with iron;
Memphian papyri, transparent and thin as the petals of a
flower.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
Cassandra told Giovanni of the wonders she had seen; of
the desolate grandeur of marble temples standing on sea-worn
cliffs, at their feet the blue Ionian waves, their columns
bedewed with the brine, like the naked body of the foam-born
goddess long ago. She told of her incredible exertions,
dangers, accidents. He asked her what she had sought, why
she had collected these things at the cost of so much toil,
and she answered in the words of Luigi her father:&mdash;
</p><p>
'To bring the dead to life.'
</p><p>
And her eyes glowed with the fire that had belonged to
Cassandra, the witch of days gone by.
</p><p>
In appearance she was little changed; she had the same
face, untouched by grief or joy&mdash;impassive as the faces of
the ancient statues; the same broad low forehead, straight
fine eyebrows, firm unsmiling lips, and amber eyes. Yet now
her face, refined by illness, or perhaps by the over-insistence
of a single thought, had taken an expression calmer and
more austere than it had worn in her girlhood. Her dark
hair, twined and wreathed like Medusa's snakes, still gave
the impression of having a life of its own, still formed a
frame for her pale face, and enhanced the brilliance of her
eyes, the scarlet of her lips. The charm of the girl attracted
Giovanni irresistibly as of old, and renewed in his soul the
old feelings of curiosity, compassion, and fear.
</p><p>
In her journey across the land of Hellas she had visited
her mother's native place, the lonely little town of Mistra,
near the ruins of Sparta, among the bare hills where, half a
century before, had died Gemistus Pletho, last teacher of
the Hellenic philosophy. Telling Giovanni of her visit to
his grave, she repeated Pletho's prophecy that after a few
years the world would return to a single faith, not differing
from the ancient paganism.
</p><p>
'The prophecy is not fulfilled,' said Giovanni, 'though
more than fifty years have passed. Have you still faith in
him, Monna Cassandra?'
</p><p>
'There was not perfect truth in Pletho,' she replied calmly,
'for there was much he did not know.'
</p><p>
'What?' asked Giovanni; and under the intentness of
her glance he felt his heart sink.
</p><p>
She took a parchment from the shelf, and read to him
certain lines from the <i>Prometheus</i>, in which the Titan,
having enumerated his gifts to men, more especially that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
fire which he had stolen from heaven, and which would
make them equal with the gods, goes on to prophesy the fall
of Zeus.
</p><p>
'Giovanni, have you never heard of the man who, ten
centuries ago, dreamed, like Pletho, of reviving the dead gods&mdash;the
Emperor Flavius Claudius Julian?'
</p><p>
'Julian the Apostate?'
</p><p>
'Ay, so they called him.'
</p><p>
'He gave his life in vain for the Olympians.' She
hesitated, then continued in a lower voice: 'If I were
to tell you all, Giovanni! But for to-day I will say only
this. Among the Olympians is a god nearer than all
others to his brethren below; a god both bright and
dark; fair as the dawn, yet pitiless as death; who came to
earth and gave to mortals&mdash;as Prometheus had done&mdash;the
forgetting of death and the boon of fire&mdash;new fire&mdash;in his
own blood, in the intoxicating juice of the vine; and, my
brother, who is there among men who will understand? who
will go boldly forth and say to the world, "The love of him
who is crowned with the vine is like the love of Him who is
crowned with thorns (who said, 'I am the true vine'); of Him
who, no less than Dionysus, makes the world drunk with his
blood?" Have you understood, Giovanni, of whom I speak?
If not, ask me nothing, for here is a secret which we may not,
as yet, reveal.'
</p><p>
Of late a great audacity of thought had come to Giovanni.
He feared nothing, because he had nothing to lose. He
had convinced himself that neither in the faith of Fra
Benedetto, nor in the knowledge of Leonardo, would he
find peace. Cassandra's prophecies gave him a glimpse of
a new idea, so startling as to be terrible. Instead of turning
away he approached it with the courage of despair. Day by
day their souls came closer to each other.
</p><p>
Once he asked her why she hid what she believed to be
the truth, why she even dissembled?
</p><p>
'All things are not for all men,' she answered. 'Martyrdoms,
wonders, and signs are necessary for the crowd. Only
those whose faith is imperfect die for their faith, that they
may convince others, and themselves. But perfect faith is
the same thing as perfect knowledge. Did the truths of
geometry discovered by Pythagoras require that he should
die in proof of them? Perfect faith is silent; and its secret is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
above profession, for the master said, "Ye know all, but be
ye known of none."'
</p><p>
'What master?' asked Giovanni, thinking of Leonardo.
</p><p>
'Basil, the Egyptian Gnostic,' she replied; and explained
that the great teachers of the early Christian ages, to whom
faith and knowledge had been one, had called themselves
Gnostics, or Knowers; and she went on to repeat to him
many of their sayings, often strange and monstrous, like the
visions of the delirious.
</p><p>
He was especially impressed by a legend as to the creation
of the world and of man, put forth by the Alexandrine
Ophites, or snake worshippers.
</p><p>
'"Above all the heavens is boundless Darkness, immovable,
fairer than any light; the Unknown Father, the Abyss, the
Silence. His only-begotten daughter, the Wisdom of God,
separating from the Father, knew life, and sorrow, and
darkened her splendour. The son of her travail was Jaldavaoth,
the creating God. Falling away from his mother he plunged
yet more deeply into existence, and created the world of the
body, a distorted image of the spiritual world. In it was
Man, formed to reflect the greatness of his creator, and to bear
witness to his power. The elemental spirits, the ministers
of Jaldavaoth, brought the senseless mass of flesh to
Jaldavaoth to be endowed with life; but the Wisdom of God
inspired it also with a breath of the divine wisdom, received by
her from the Unknown Father. And then this mean creature,
formed of earth and dust, became greater than Jaldavaoth its
creator, and grew into the shape and the likeness not of him
but of the true God, the Unknown Father. Four-footed Man
raised his face from the earth, and Jaldavaoth, at the sight of
the being which had slipped from his power, was filled with
anger and alarm. He formed another creature, the Angel of
Darkness, the serpent-like Satan, the wisdom accursed. And
by the help of the serpent Jaldavaoth formed the three kingdoms
of Nature; and set Man therein, and gave him a law.
"Do this; do not that: if thou breakest the law, thou shalt
die." For he hoped by the yoke of the law, and by the fear
of death to recover his power over man. But the Wisdom of
God still protected Man, and sent him a comforter, the Spirit
of Knowledge&mdash;snake-like also, but winged like the morning
star, the Angel of the Dawn, him to whom allusion is made in
the saying, "Be ye wise as the serpent." And the Spirit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
Knowledge went down to men and said, "Taste and know,
and your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods."'
</p><p>
'Hearken, Giovanni,' concluded Cassandra; 'the men of the
crowd, the children of this world, are the slaves of Jaldavaoth
and of the serpent Satan, living under the fear of death,
bound by the yoke of the law. But the children of light, those
who <i>know</i>, the chosen of Sophia, the Wisdom of God, transcend
all laws, overstep all bounds, are free as gods, are furnished
with wings, remain pure in the midst of evil, even as gold
glitters in the mire. And the Spirit of Knowledge, the Angel
of the Dawn, leads them through life and death, through evil
and through good, through all the curses and the terrors of
the world of Jaldavaoth, to the great mother, Sophia, the
Wisdom of God; and she bringeth them to the bosom of the
great Darkness, which reigns above the heavens, which is
immovable and fairer than any light; to the bosom of the
Father of all things.'
</p><p>
And hearing this legend of the Ophites, Giovanni could not
help inwardly comparing Jaldavaoth to the son of Kronos;
the breath of Divine Wisdom to the fire of Prometheus; the
Beneficent Serpent the Angel of the Dawn, Lucifer, Son of the
Morning, to Prometheus the Titan. In all ages and nations, in
the tragedies of Æschylus, in the legend of the Gnostics, in the
history of Julian the Apostate, in the teaching of Pletho the
philosopher, Giovanni found the echoes of the great discord,
the same great struggle, which darkened his own spirit. Ten
centuries ago men were suffering as he suffered now, were
contending with the same double thoughts, were the victims
of the same contradictions, the same temptations. The
knowledge that this was so solaced him, yet it deepened his
anguish. Sometimes he felt overwhelmed by all these
thoughts as by drunkenness or delirium. And then it seemed
to him that Cassandra only pretended to be strong and
inspired and initiated into the mystery of truth, while in
reality she was no less ignorant, no less astray than he was
himself; and that the two of them were as helpless and lost
as they had been twelve years before; and this new sabbath
of half divine, half satanic lore was even more senseless than
the Witches' Sabbath to which she had once invited him, and
which she now despised as childishness. Giovanni became
alarmed and wished to flee, but it was too late; curiosity drew
him like a spell, and he felt he would not leave her till he knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
all to the end; till he had found salvation and had perished
with her.
</p><p>
Now about this time there came to Milan a famous
inquisitor and doctor of theology, Fra Giorgio de Casale.
</p><p>
The Pope, Julius <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>., alarmed by the spread of sorcery in
Lombardy, had sent him with bulls and powers of committal
and of extraordinary punishments. Monna Cassandra stood
in grave peril; and was warned both by the nuns of the
Monastero Maggiore and by the archbishop. She and Messer
Galeotto had already fled from Rome to escape this same Fra
Giorgio; they knew that once fallen into his hands they
would find no escape, and determined to take refuge in
France, perhaps in England or even Scotland.
</p><p>
Two days before their setting forth, Giovanni was with
Cassandra in her lonely room of the Palazzo Carmagnole.
The sunshine, veiled by the thick cypress branches, was
scarce brighter than moonlight; the girl seemed even fairer
and calmer than was her wont. Now that parting was at
hand, Giovanni realised how dear she was to him.
</p><p>
'Shall I not see you yet once more?' he asked her.
'Will you not reveal to me that mystery of which you have
spoken?'
</p><p>
Cassandra looked fixedly at him; then drew from a casket
a flat four-cornered stone of transparent green. It was the
famous 'Tabula Smaragdina,' the emerald tablet said to
have been found in a cave near Memphis in the hands of the
mummy of a certain priest, who was an incarnation of
Hermes Trismegistus, the Egyptian Horus, the god of
boundaries, the guide of the dead to the underworld. It was
engraved both in Coptic and in Greek with these verses.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>'Come to me this night,' she said gravely and softly, 'and
I will tell you all that I know myself&mdash;do you hear?&mdash;all, to
the very end. And now before we part, let us drink together
the cup of friendship.'
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
She fetched a small pottery vessel, sealed with wax as in
the far East, poured out wine, thick as oil, golden-ruddy, and
with a strange perfume, into an ancient goblet of chrysolite,
with a relief of Dionysus and the Bacchantes. Going to the
window she raised the cup as if about to pour a libation; the
rosy wine, like warm blood, gave life to the figures of the
naked Mænads on the transparent cup.
</p><p>
'There was a time, Giovanni,' she said, 'when I fancied
that your Master Leonardo possessed the great secret, for
his face is as that of an Olympian god, blended with a Titan.
But now I see he aims, but he does not attain; seeks and
finds not; knows, but understands not. <i>He is the precursor
of him who shall come after him, who is greater than he.</i> Let
us drink together, O my brother, this farewell goblet to the Unknown
whom we both invoke; to the supreme Reconciler.'
</p><p>
Devoutly, as if performing a religious rite, she drank half
the cup and handed it to Giovanni.
</p><p>
'Fear not!' she said, 'this is no poisoned philtre; this
wine is from grapes of Nazareth; 'tis the purest blood of
<i>Dionysus, the Galilæan</i>!'
</p><p>
When he had drunk, she laid her hands on his shoulders,
and whispered rapidly and solemnly&mdash;
</p><p>
'If you would know all, Come! Come, and I will tell
you the secret, which never yet have I uttered to any one.
I will reveal the extreme joy, the extreme sorrow which
shall unite us for ever, as brother and sister, as bridegroom
and bride.'
</p><p>
In the sun's rays, veiled by the thick cypresses, and pale
as moonlight, just as once before by the Cantarana water in
the whiteness of the summer lightning, she put her face close
to his, her face white as marble, framed by its Medusa locks,
with its scarlet lips, its amber eyes.
</p><p>
The chill of a familiar terror froze Giovanni's heart, and he
said to himself:&mdash;
</p><p>
'<i>La Diavolessa bianca!</i>'
</p><p>
That night at the appointed hour Giovanni stood at
the door of the Palazzo Carmagnole. He knocked long,
but none opened to him. At last he went to the Monastero
Maggiore, and there he learned the terrible news. Fra Giorgio
da Casale had appeared suddenly, and had given orders at
once to apprehend Galeotto Sacrobosco and his niece
Cassandra on a charge of black magic.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>

Messer Galeotto had succeeded in escaping, but Cassandra
was already in the clutch of the Holy Inquisition.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Next day Boltraffio did not leave his bed. He was indisposed,
and his head ached; he was half unconscious, and
cared for nothing.
</p><p>
At nightfall there was an unwonted pealing of bells, and
through his room spread a faint but repulsive odour. His
headache increased, he felt sick, and he went out into the air.
The day was warm and damp, a day of <i>scirocco</i>, frequent at
Milan in the early autumn. There was no rain, but the roofs
and the trees dripped, and the brick pavement was shining
and slippery. Yet in the open air Giovanni found the
noisome odour still stronger than in his room.
</p><p>
The streets were thronged, the people all coming from the
Piazza del Broletto; as Giovanni looked in their faces he
fancied them in the same state of semi-unconsciousness as
himself. Presently chance words from a passer-by explained
to him the noisome odour which pursued him; it was the
appalling stench of burned human bodies. They were
burning witches, sorceresses. Perhaps&mdash;O God!&mdash;burning
Cassandra!
</p><p>
He began to run, not knowing whither, jostling people,
staggering like a drunken man, trembling with ague, feeling
the foul savour in the greasy and yellow mist, feeling it follow
him, catch him by the throat, stifle his lungs, bind his
temples with a dull and gnawing pain.
</p><p>
He never remembered how he made his way to the
Monastery of San Francisco and to Fra Benedetto's cell. It
was empty, for Benedetto was at Bergamo. Giovanni shut
the door, lit a candle, and sank exhausted on the pallet-bed.
</p><p>
In this familiar and peaceful retreat all breathed of holiness
and peace. The stench had dissipated, he smelt only
incense, fast-day olives, old books, and the varnish for
Benedetto's simple paintings. On the wall hung a crucifix
and an ancient gift of Giovanni's, a withered garland of
flowers gathered on the heights of Fiesole in those days when
he sat at the feet of Savonarola.
</p><p>
He raised his eyes to the Crucified. The Saviour still
extended his nailed hand as if calling the world to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
embrace: 'Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy-laden.'
Was not that the one, the perfect truth?
</p><p>
But the prayer died on his lips. Not though eternal
damnation threatened him could he cease to know what he
did know, could he drive out or reconcile the two truths
which were contending in him. In his old calm despair he
turned away from the Crucified, and at the same moment he
fancied that the noisome mist, the terrible stench of the
burning had reached him even here in this last refuge.
</p><p>
And there rose before him a vision which he had seen
often of late, so distinct he scarce knew if it were reality or
dream; the vision of Cassandra in the glow of the scarlet
flame, among the instruments of torture and stains of blood;
she white, virginal, firm as the marble of a statue, preserved
by the power of the Beneficent Serpent, the Reconciler, the
Deliverer, insensible to the iron and the flame and the gaze
of her tormentors.
</p><p>
Coming to himself, he knew by the dying candle, by the
strokes of the convent clock, that hours had passed in
oblivion, and that it was now past midnight. It was very
still, and the air was hot. Through the window were seen
pale blue flashes of lightning, as on that memorable night
long ago by the Cantarana. The dull roar of distant thunder
seemed to come from below the earth. His head ached, his
mouth was parched, thirst tortured him; he remembered
having seen a pitcher of water in the corner. He rose,
dragging himself along by the wall, found it, drank, and was
returning to his couch when he became conscious that some
one was with him in the cell. Seated on the couch was a
figure in the long dark habit of a monk, a hood covering the
face. He was astonished, for the door was locked, yet he
felt relieved rather than alarmed. His head ceased to ache,
his senses were quickened. He approached the seated
figure. It rose, and the cowl fell back; Giovanni saw the
face, marble white, passionless, the lips red as blood, the
amber eyes, the halo of black hair like Medusa's snakes.
</p><p>
Solemnly, slowly, as if for an incantation, Cassandra rose,
her arms extended. The black robe fell back. He saw the
glowing warmth and beauty of her neck. Was she alive?
My God! was she alive?
</p><p>
For the last time Giovanni murmured, 'The white sorceress!'
It seemed as if the veil of life were rent before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
him. He was face to face with the mystery of the supreme
union. She knelt before him.... She folded him in her
arms.... Ah! the inexpressible sweetness! the inexpressible
fear!... Delirium! delirium!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Zoroastro da Peretola had not died, neither had he recovered
from his fall. He was a cripple, and able to mutter
only fragmentary words intelligible to none but the Master.
Sometimes he roamed about the house, clattering on his
crutches; sometimes he listened to conversation as if trying
to understand it; or he would sit in a corner winding strips
of linen, or planing wooden staves, whittling sticks or carving
tops, for his workman's hands had not lost their need of
movement, nor entirely their skill. But often he would rock
himself for hours together, a smile on his face, and his arms
waving as if they were wings, while he crooned an unending
ditty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Cucurlu! Curlu!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Cranes and eagles</p>
<p>&nbsp;Up they flew!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Up they flew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Cranes and eagles,&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Cucurlu!'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>And then, looking at the Master, he would weep&mdash;a sight too
painful for Leonardo to bear. He never deserted the broken
creature, but cared for him, gave him money, and whenever
possible kept him in his house. Years passed, and the
cripple remained a living reproof, a mockery of his life-long
effort, his fashioning of wings for men.
</p><p>
Scarce less distressed was Leonardo by the attitude of
Cesare da Sesto, that one of his pupils who was perhaps
nearest to his heart. Like Astro and Giovanni he was
mentally crippled, anxious to stand alone, but overwhelmed
by the Master's influence, and reduced to nullity. Not
content to be an imitator, not strong enough to be independent,
he wore himself out with fruitless fretting
and impotent rage, incompetent either to save himself or to
perish. He was one of those upon whom Leonardo was
accused of having cast the Evil Eye.
</p><p>
Cesare was said to be in secret correspondence with
Raphael, who was working at the frescoes of the Vatican
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
Stanze, and Leonardo sometimes thought treachery was
meditated. But worse than the treachery of enemies was
the so-called fidelity of friends. Under the name of the
<i>Accademia di Leonardo</i>, a school of young painters had grown
up in Milan, a few of them his pupils, the greater number
newcomers, who clung to him like parasites, and persuaded
themselves and others that they were following in his steps.
He stood aloof, and watched them. At times disgust overwhelmed
him when he saw how all that he had reverenced
as great and sacred had become the property of the common
herd; how the Lord's face in the <i>Cenacolo</i> was copied till it
was mere ecclesiastical commonplace; how the smile of La
Gioconda was imitated, exaggerated, vulgarised, till it became
stupid, if not sensual.
</p><p>
One winter's night Leonardo was sitting alone, listening
to the shriek and roar of the storm; it was just such a night
as that in which he had heard of Monna Lisa's death; he was
thinking of her, and thinking of Death itself, of the last dread
solitude in the bosom of ancient Chaos, of the infinite weariness
of the world. There was a knock; he rose and opened the
door. A young man entered, a lad of nineteen, with bright
eyes, fresh cheeks reddened by the cold, melting snowflakes
in his chestnut curls.
</p><p>
'Oh Messer Leonardo!' he exclaimed, 'do you not know
me?'
</p><p>
Leonardo looked and recognised his little friend, the child
with whom he had roamed the woods of Vaprio, Francesco
Melzi. He embraced him with fatherly tenderness. The
youth related how, after the French invasion of 1500, his
father had taken his family to Bologna, and there had fallen
sick of a malady which had lasted for long years. Now he
was dead, and the son had hastened to Leonardo, remembering
his promise.
</p><p>
'But what promise?' asked the painter, bewildered.
</p><p>
'Ah! you have forgotten! And I, poor simpleton, have
been counting on it! Nay, then! do you not remember?
You were carrying me in the mine at the foot of Monte
Campione, and you told me how you were to serve Cæsar
Borgia in Romagna. And I wept, and prayed you to take
me with you, and you promised that after ten years' time,
when I should be grown&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
'Ay! I recall it!' said Leonardo warmly.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
'You see? Ah, Messer Leonardo, I know you have no
need of me. But I will be no burden to you, I will not
disturb you. Pr'ythee drive me not hence! If you drive me
hence, I will not go! I will never leave you again!' cried
the lad.
</p><p>
'My dear, dear boy!' said the Master, and his voice shook.
</p><p>
He embraced him again, and Francesco clung to his breast
as he had done years ago when Leonardo had carried him
into the subterranean darkness of the forgotten pit.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Since Leonardo had left Florence in 1507, he had been
enrolled as court painter in the service of the French King,
Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span> He had no fixed salary, but relied on the royal
bounty. The treasurers frequently forgot him altogether, nor
was he able to call opportune attention to himself by his
productions, for as years increased upon him he worked less
and less. He was consequently, as of old, in continual
straits and entanglements; he borrowed wherever he could,
and contracted new debts before he had paid off the old.
He wrote the same timid, clumsy petitions to the French
Viceroy and Treasurer as formerly to the officials of Ludovico
Il Moro.
</p><p>
'Not wishing to fatigue your Excellency's generosity, I
permit myself to request that I may receive a regular salary.
More than once have I addressed your lordship on this
subject, but hitherto have been vouchsafed no reply.'
</p><p>
In the ante-chambers of his patrons he quietly waited his
turn among other suppliants, though with advancing years he
increasingly knew&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'How salt another's bread is, and the toil</p>
<p>&nbsp;Of going up and down another's stairs.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The service of princes was as bitter to him as had been
the service of the republic; everywhere and always he felt
himself a stranger. Raphael had become rich and splendid
as a Roman patrician; Michelangelo was hoarding money
against the evil days; Leonardo was still a homeless
wanderer, not knowing where he could lay his head when
he came to die.

Wars, victories, the defeat of his friends, changes in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
governments and laws, the enslaving of peoples, the chasing
forth of tyrants&mdash;all that to the generality seems important,
was to him as a whirl of dust to a wayfarer on a high road.
With equal indifference he fortified the Castle of Milan for
the French king against the Lombards, as once he had fortified
it for the Duke of Lombardy against the French.
</p><p>
Trivulzio, the ambitious general, was intriguing against
Massimiliano, and Leonardo saw the fate of the father, Il
Moro, threatening Il Moretto. Wearied by these monotonous
and arbitrary political changes, sickened by the manufacture
of triumphal arches and the mending of the wings of the
trumpery angels, he determined to leave Milan and pass into
the service of the Medici.
</p><p>
In Rome, however&mdash;for Giovanni de Medici, having
become pope, with the style of Leo <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, had nominated his
brother Giuliano as Gonfaloniere of the Holy Church. He
had already gone to Rome, and it was arranged that Leonardo
should join him in the autumn. He was to be both painter
and 'alchemist' in Giuliano's service.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the morrow of the day when the hundred and thirty-nine
witches had been burned in the Piazza del Broletto, the
monks of San Francesco had found Giovanni Boltraffio
stretched senseless on the floor of Fra Benedetto's cell.
Clearly he was suffering, as he had suffered fifteen years earlier,
after having heard the tale of Savonarola's martyrdom. On this
second occasion his recovery was rapid; nevertheless there
were times when his unspeculative eye, his strangely impassive
face inspired Leonardo with greater fear than during his
long illness of years ago.
</p><p>
However that might be, on the 23rd of September 1513
Leonardo rode out of Milan for Rome to join his new patron
Giuliano, with Francesco Melzi, Salaino, Cesare, Astro, and
Giovanni.</p>

<h2>BOOK XVI<br />
<small>LEONARDO, MICHELANGELO, AND RAPHAEL&mdash;1513-1515</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="bookblock"><i>La pazienza fa contra alle ingiurie non altrimenti che si faccino i panni
contra del freddo; imperò che, se ti multiplicherai di panni secondo la
multiplicazione del freddo, esso freddo nocere non ti potrà; similmente

<p class="bookblock">(Patience acts against insults as garments act against cold. With the
doubling of your misfortunes, put on a double cloak of endurance.)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="p2">I</h3>

<p>Pope Leo <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span>, true to the traditions of the house of the
Medici, posed as patron of art and learning. When he heard
of his own election he said to his brother:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Let us <i>enjoy</i> the papal power, since God has conceded it
to us!'
</p><p>
And Fra Mariano, his favourite jester added:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Seek your own pleasure, Holy Father! All else is folly.'
</p><p>
The pope surrounded himself with poets, musicians,
painters, and scholars. A golden age had dawned for
imitative men of letters, who had one unassailable article of
faith, the perfection of Cicero's prose and of Virgil's poetry.
</p><p>
The shepherds of Christ's flock avoided the mention of His
name, because it was a word unknown to Cicero's <i>Orations</i>.
They called nuns, vestals; the Holy Ghost, the Inspiration of
the Supreme Jove; and they requested the Pope to include
Plato in the roll of saints. Bembo, a future cardinal, owned
that he did not read the Epistles of Paul (he called them
<i>Epistolaccie</i>) lest he should spoil his style. When Francis <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>
asked for the Laocoön, Leo <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span> replied that he would sooner
give him the head of Peter the Apostle.
</p><p>
The pope loved his scholars and artists, his poets and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
pedants; but above all he loved his jesters. He solemnly
crowned Cuerno, the celebrated rhymster and drunkard, and
was no less liberal to him than to Raphael. He spent huge
sums on feasts, though he ate sparingly himself, being afflicted
with a weak digestion, and an incurable purulent disease;
and his soul was no less sick than his body, for he suffered
from continual <i>ennui</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Leonardo first presented himself at the Vatican he
was told that his only hope of obtaining audience of His
Holiness was to declare himself a buffoon. He did not
follow this good advice, and failed of admission time and
again. Of late he had experienced strange forebodings which
he tried to put from him as senseless and absurd. It was
not anxiety as to his affairs which oppressed him; nor was it
his failure to gain adequate recognition from Leo <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span> or
Giuliano de' Medici. He had been too long used to annoyances
of this kind. But his vague disquiet, his ominous
apprehension, continually increased; till one radiant autumn
evening, as he was returning from the Vatican, his heart sank,
under the pressure of imminent catastrophe.
</p><p>
He was living in the same house where he had lived during
his former visit to Rome; one of the small detached buildings
behind St. Peter's, which had belonged to the Papal Mint.
It was old and gloomy, and having been unoccupied for
several years was exceedingly damp. He entered a large
vaulted apartment with cracks on walls and ceiling, and
windows overshadowed by the wall of the adjoining house.
</p><p>
In the corner sat Astro the imbecile, his feet drawn up
under him, his hands busy whittling sticks, while he purred
his monotonous lullaby&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>Cucurlu, curlu!</p>
<p>Eagles and cranes</p>
<p>Up they flew!</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Leonardo's anxiety perceptibly increased.
</p><p>
'What's the matter, Astro?' he asked kindly, laying his
hand on the cripple's head.
</p><p>
'Nothing,' said Astro, with a curious look of intelligence,
'nothing with me. It's Giovanni. But it's all the better for
him. He has flown away.'
</p><p>
'Giovanni? Where is Giovanni?' cried Leonardo, suddenly
realising that his forebodings had centred on this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
unhappy disciple. 'Astro! I implore you, my friend, try to
remember! Where is Giovanni? I must see him at once.
Where is he? What has happened?'
</p><p>
'Don't you understand?' muttered Astro, vainly seeking
for the right words. 'He is up there&mdash;he has escaped&mdash;flown
away. You don't understand? I will show you then.
It is better for him to have flown away.'
</p><p>
He rolled himself to his feet and shuffled along on his
crutches, leading his master up the creaking stair to the attic,
where the sun burned hot on the tiled roof, and the sunset
rays shone upon the dormer-window. As they entered,
startled pigeons fluttered their wings noisily and flew away.
</p><p>
'There he is,' said Astro, simply, and pointed to a dark
corner. Leonardo saw the figure of Giovanni, apparently
standing, very erect and quite motionless, his widely opened
eyes staring fixedly straight before him. 'Giovanni!' cried
Leonardo, with shaking voice, a cold sweat bursting out on
his forehead.
</p><p>
He drew nearer; saw that the face was strangely distorted;
touched the nerveless hand, and felt it cold. The body
oscillated heavily to and fro. Giovanni had hanged himself
from an iron hook lately inserted for mechanical purposes
into the cross beam; and by means of a strong silken cord,
one of the attachments of the flying machine.
</p><p>
Astro had fallen back into his torpor, and was looking
serenely out of the window. The house stood high, and
commanded a view of the tiled roofs, the domes and towers
of Rome, of the Campagna spreading like a sea, traversed by
long lines of ruined aqueducts, of the hills of Albano and
Frascati, of the clear sky where the swallows swooped and
circled. Astro watched them, and smiled, and waved his
arms joyously as if imitating their flight.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>Cucurlu!</p>
<p>Up they flew!</p>
<p>Curlu!</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>he crooned contentedly.
</p><p>
Leonardo stood, still as a stone, between his two disciples,
the imbecile and the suicide.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few days later he found Giovanni's diary and read it
attentively.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
'The white witch!' always and everywhere! May she be
accursed. The last mystery: two shall be in one. Christ
and Antichrist are one. The heaven above&mdash;the heaven
below!
</p><p>
'No! No! This shall not, must not be! Rather, death!'
</p><p>
'Into thy hands I commit my spirit, O God! Be thou my
Judge!'
</p><p>
There came an abrupt end to the entries. Leonardo understood
that these words had been penned on the day of the
writer's suicide.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>II</h3>

<p>After the death of Giovanni, Leonardo wearied of his life
in Rome. Uncertainty, waiting, forced inaction enervated
him. His usual occupations, his books, machines, experiments,
paintings failed in interest.

Leo <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span> had not yet found time to receive him, nor to give
him the order for a painting. However, he set the artist to
the mechanical task of perfecting the coining mill for the
Papal Mint. Leonardo despised no work, however humble;
he did what was required, and devised new machinery, by
means of which the coins, uneven and jagged before, were
cut perfectly true. The artist was at this time overwhelmed
with debts, and the greater part of his salary went in the
payment of the interest on his borrowings. But for the
generosity of Francesco Melzi, who had inherited property
from his father, he would have been in extreme want.
</p><p>
In the summer of 1514 he was attacked by the malaria.
It was his first serious illness. He refused doctors and
medicines, but allowed Francesco to wait upon him. Every
day he became more attached to this lad, and felt that God
had sent him a guardian angel, a prop for his old age. Men
seemed to be forgetting him, but from time to time he made
attempts to remind them of his existence. From his sick-bed
he wrote to Giuliano de' Medici with striving after the fashionable
compliments which did not come easily to his lips
or pen.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>III</h3>

<p>After much rain the end of November brought sunny days,
never so beautiful as in Rome, where the decaying splendour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
of autumn harmonises well with the ruined glories of the
Eternal City.
</p><p>
One morning Leonardo went with Francesco to see the
Sistine Chapel and the frescoes of Michelangelo; a visit
long purposed, but deferred as if from a secret sense of fear.
</p><p>
The chapel is a long, narrow, very lofty building, with plain
walls and Gothic windows. Buonarroti had covered the
ceiling and arches with biblical scenes. Leonardo looked,
and staggered, as if faint; whatever his secret expectation, he
had never thought to behold such potency of art.
</p><p>
In face of the colossal figures, sublime as the visions of
delirium&mdash;the God of Sabaoth dividing light from darkness
in the bosom of Chaos, blessing the waters and plants, creating
Adam from the earth, and Eve from Adam's rib&mdash;in face
of the representations of the Fall, the Redemption and all the
incidents of Scripture history; in face of the beautiful nude
youths, spirits of the elements accompanying the tragedy
of the Universe, the conflict of God and Man, with eternal
dancing and song; prophets and sibyls, terrible giants that
seemed weighed down with more than human wisdom and
with more than human woe; the ancestors of the Messiah,
a long file of obscure patriarchs passing on from one to the
other the purposeless burden of life, awaiting in darkness the
coming of the unknown Redeemer;&mdash;in face of these stupendous
creations of his rival Leonardo did not measure, nor compare
nor judge; he felt himself and his work annihilated.
</p><p>
He enumerated his own productions; the <i>Cenacolo</i>, which
was perishing, the Colossus, which had been destroyed, the
'Battle of Anghiari,' and an endless number of other unfinished
paintings; a succession of vain endeavours, ridiculous failures,
inglorious defeats. He had spent his life in beginning,
intending, making ready; he had achieved nothing. Why
deceive himself? It was too late now; he would never
accomplish anything. His life had been expended in incredible
labour; yet now at its close he felt like the slothful servant
in the parable who had buried his talent in the earth.
</p><p>
Yet he was conscious that he had aimed at something
higher than this other man; to Michelangelo all was turmoil,
chaos; Leonardo had seen, and had tried to show, the eternal
harmony. He remembered Monna Lisa's parable of the
mighty wind, and of the still small voice where the Lord was;
he felt that she had discerned a truth, that sooner or later
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
the human mind would return to the path he had shown, the
path from discord to harmony, from division to unity, from
storm to quietness. The consciousness of how entirely right
he had been in theory made still more painful to him, the
consciousness of impotence in action.
</p><p>
They left the chapel in silence. Francesco ventured no
questions; but he fancied that the Master had suddenly
aged, had become feeble and broken. Years had apparently
passed since they had entered the chapel.
</p><p>
Crossing the Piazza of St. Peter's, they went by the Borgo
Nuovo towards the bridge of St. Angelo. Leonardo was
thinking of another rival whom he had perhaps no less
reason to fear, Raphael Sanzio. He had seen the young
painter's newly finished frescoes in the Stanze of the Vatican,
and had felt unable to decide whether the greatness of
the execution were not equalled by the poverty of the
conception, the perfection of eye and hand by the servile
flattery of the princes of this world. Julius <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> had dreamed
of expelling the French from Italy; therefore Raphael had
shown him watching the expulsion of Heliogabalus from the
profaned temple of the most high God. Leo <span class="smcap lowercase">X.</span> posed as a
great orator; therefore Raphael celebrated him in the
person of Leo the Great, warning Attila to retreat from
Rome. He had been taken prisoner by the French and had
escaped; Raphael represented this by the miraculous deliverance
of St. Peter. Thus he degraded his art into the
nauseous incense of a courtier's flattery.
</p><p>
This stranger from Urbino, this dreamy youth with the
face of a sinless angel, had managed his mundane affairs to
the best advantage. He painted the stables of Chigi the
banker; made designs for the table-service of gold which,
after the entertaining of the Holy Father, the banker threw
into the Tiber, that it might never be used by any one less
illustrious. The 'fortunate boy,' as Francia called the young
painter, acquired fame and wealth as if by play. He disarmed
his worst enemies by kindliness; he was what he
appeared to be, the friend of all. In everything he succeeded.
The gifts of Fortune dropped unsought into his hands. He
replaced Bramante on the architectural conclave for the
building of the new cathedral; Cardinal Bibbiena offered him
his niece in marriage; it was said he had been promised a
cardinal's hat. He built a dainty mansion in the Borgo, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
furnished it with regal splendour. His ante-chamber was
crowded with official personages, and with envoys from abroad,
who either wanted their portraits painted, or desired to take
home some specimen of the great man's art. He was overwhelmed
with patrons and refused new ones. They insisted.
Time was wanting to execute his innumerable orders, and
many of his pictures were chiefly painted by his pupils. His
studio became a factory where such skilful workmen as Giulio
Romano turned canvas and paint into ready-money with
amazing facility. He himself apparently desisted from the
search after perfection, and was content with popularity. He
served the people, and they accepted him enthusiastically as
their chosen, their beloved, bone of their bone, flesh of their
flesh, the incarnation of their own spirit.
</p><p>
The worst of it was, that in his fall he was still great; a
seduction not only to the vulgar herd, but also to the elect.
He seemed unspoiled by the glittering baubles showered on
him by Fortune. He remained innocent and pure. The
<i>fortunato garzone</i> had no consciousness of the danger for
himself and for art. For in this superficial harmony, in
this pseudo-reconciliation of discordant elements, there was
greater danger for the future than in the chaos and contradictions
and wars introduced by Michelangelo. Leonardo
could see nothing beyond the work of these two painters;
after them, all seemed abysmal and void. He felt how
much both owed to himself. From him they had had their
science of light and shade, their anatomy, their perspective,
their knowledge of Nature and of man. Yes, they had
grown out of him; and now the two of them, they had
destroyed him! Leonardo walked silently beside his young
companion, his eyes downcast, his head bent, his face intensely
sorrowful and <i>old</i>: he seemed in a trance.
</p><p>
As they approached the bridge, they had to draw aside
to give room to a cavalcade&mdash;some great man, a cardinal,
perhaps, or an ambassador, escorted by sixteen horsemen
richly attired. The personage proved a young man,
sumptuously clad, riding a grey Arab with gilded and jewelled
trappings. His face seemed familiar; and suddenly Leonardo
remembered the pale shy youth in the girlish frock, daubed
with paint and worn into holes at the elbow, who eight years
before had said, 'Michelangelo is not worthy to tie the latchet
of your shoe!'
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
Now this boy was the rival both of Leonardo and Michelangelo,
and was called 'the God of Painting'!
</p><p>
His face, though still boyish, innocent, and unseared by
emotion, was somewhat less of a seraph's. He was a man of the
great world now; riding from his villa in the Borgo to an interview
with the pope, he was accompanied by a troop of pupils,
admirers, and friends. Indeed he never went out with an
escort of less than fifteen. His every ride seemed a triumphal
procession.
</p><p>
He recognised Leonardo; flushed slightly, and with quick,
even exaggerated respect, doffed his cap and bowed. His
younger pupils looked wonderingly at the old man to whom
the 'Divine One' showed so much respect; the quiet shabby
old man, hugging the wall to let the cavalcade dash by.
</p><p>
Leonardo's attention was caught by the man riding at
Raphael's side, apparently the most favoured of his pupils.
It was Cesare da Sesto. Leonardo gazed in amazement, scarce
able to believe his eyes. Now he understood Cesare's long
absence, Francesco's clumsy explanation. The last of his
disciples, he whom he had trusted to follow in his footsteps
and carry on his method, had deserted and betrayed him.
Cesare braved his gaze without flinching; nay, it was
Leonardo whose eyes fell in confusion, as if guilty before the
other of some unintended crime.
</p><p>
The cavalcade passed on, and the old man, leaning upon
Francesco, went his way. They crossed Hadrian's bridge,
and went by the Via dei Coronari to the Piazza Navona,
where was the bird fair. Leonardo bought magpies, finches,
thrushes, pigeons, a falcon, and a young wild swan. He
spent all the money he had with him, and borrowed also of
Francesco. Slung from head to foot with cages, the quaint pair
attracted general attention. The passers-by stared curiously,
the little boys ran after them. They walked past the Pantheon
and Trajan's Forum, crossed the Esquiline, and left the town
by the Porta Maggiore, following the ancient Roman road
called the Via Labicana. Presently they turned into a narrow
footpath leading into the solitude of the wild country.

Before them spread the boundless, the silent, the
monotonous Campagna; through the arches of the Claudian
Aqueduct, low hills were seen, uniform grey-green, like sea
waves in the light of evening; here and there was a solitary
tower, the deserted nest of robber knights; misty blue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
mountains surrounded the great plain, like the tiers of a
colossal amphitheatre.
</p><p>
Over the city brooded the great peace of autumn twilight.
The last rays of the sun, streaming from between heavy clouds,
lay across the landscape in broad zones of brilliance, and
shone on a herd of white cattle, which scarce turned their
heads at the sound of footsteps. The chirp of the grasshopper,
the rustle of the breeze in the stalks of the withered summer
flowers, the dull sound of the distant bells, but enforced the
stillness; it seemed that here in this immense plain, so desolate
so solemn, had already been fulfilled the prophecy of the angel
who swore by him that liveth for ever and ever, there should be
time no longer. They chose a convenient hillock, and relieved
themselves of the cages; then Leonardo set the birds free.
</p><p>
As they flew away, with the joyous flutter and rustle of
their wings, he followed them with loving eyes. He smiled,
he forgot his griefs, and was happy as in his childhood.
Only the falcon and the swan were still in their cages; their
emancipation was reserved for a later hour.
</p><p>
Now he and Francesco ate a frugal supper of bread,
chestnuts, dried cherries, cheese, a flask of the golden Orvieto
wine. They were still silent. Francesco glanced at his
master from time to time. Leonardo's hair was silvered and
thin, his forehead lined, his deep-set eyes were still luminous
and thoughtful, but weary. Age had set its effacing finger
on the beauty of every feature. It was the face of an
enfeebled, patient Titan.
</p><p>
Francesco pitied him, as he pitied all persons who were
lonely and sorrowful. The Master, whom of all men he
admired and loved, whom he set above the Michelangelo
and the Raphael of the people's applause, was but a lonely
and poor and despised old man, sitting on the grass among
empty bird-cages, cutting his cheese with an old broken
clasp-knife, chewing his bread with an effort because his jaws
were weakened by age, his appetite lost by recent illness.
A lump rose in Francesco's throat, and he would gladly have
knelt and assured his friend of his devotion, but he did not
do so&mdash;he lacked the courage. At all times, even to those
who loved him the best, Leonardo showed something alien
and unapproachable.
</p><p>
The modest supper ended, Leonardo rose, let loose the
hawk, then opened the last and largest cage, that one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
containing the wild swan. The great white bird came out noisily,
stood dazzled for a minute flapping its wings, then flew
straight towards the sun. Leonardo watched it with eyes
full of unspoken grief. It was grief for the idle dream of his
whole life, for the human wings, for the 'Great Bird' of
which he had written in his diary: 'Man shall fly like a
mighty swan.'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>At last the Pope, yielding to the persuasions of his brother
Giuliano, ordered a small picture from Leonardo. As usual
he hesitated, put off beginning from day to day, spent his
time in preliminary attempts, in perfecting his paints, in the
invention of a new varnish.
</p><p>
His Holiness exclaimed in mock despair&mdash;
</p><p>
'Alack! this dull fellow will never perform anything; he
studies the end before he has mastered the beginning.'
</p><p>
The saying was repeated by the courtiers, and all over the
town, and it sealed the fate of the painter. Leo, the supreme
judge in matters of art, had pronounced sentence. Hence-forward
Raphael, Buonarroti, Bembo the pedant, and Baraballo
the buffoon, need fear no rivalry; the pope had jested, and
the painter's reputation was crushed. The world forgot him,
as it forgets the dead. When some one repeated Leo's
witticism for his entertainment, he smiled indifferently, as if
mockery were no worse than he had expected. That night
however, he wrote in his diary:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Patience is to the injured what clothes are to the frozen.
With keener cold, augment your clothing and it shall not hurt
you; with the increase of humiliation, double your cloak of
patience.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XII.</span>, King of France, died in 1515. Having no son,
his crown passed to his nearest relative, Francis of Valois,
Duke of Angoulême, who assumed the title of Francis <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span>
</p><p>
The young king at once took the field for the reconquest
of Lombardy. He crossed the Alps, appeared suddenly in
Italy, gained a victory at Marignano, deposed Il Moretto,
and entered Milan in triumph. About the same time
Giuliano de' Medici left Rome for Savoy, and Leonardo, out
of favour with the Pope, determined to try his fortune with
the new sovereign. In the autumn he went to Pavia to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
court of Francis. Here the conquered were celebrating the
conquest and the glory of the conqueror, and Leonardo was
at once invited to arrange the festival, his reputation as
mechanician in the time of Il Moro being remembered. He
agreed; and amongst other things constructed a lion which
ran automatically across the hall, stood rampant before the
king, and opened his breast, from which fell a shower of the
white <i>fleurs de lys</i>. This toy made Leonardo more famous
than all his great works, inventions, and discoveries. Francis
was anxious to see Italian scholars and artists at his court, but
the pope refused to spare either Michelangelo or Raphael,
so Leonardo was offered a salary of seven hundred crowns
and the little château of Cloux, in Touraine, near the town
of Amboise, between Tours and Blois.
</p><p>
The artist accepted the offer; and in the sixty-fourth year
of his life began once more his endless wandering; left his
country without hope of return, and settled in the foreign
land. He was accompanied by Francesco Melzi, Zoroastro,
and his old servants, Battista de Villanis and the fat cook
Maturina.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
The road, especially in winter, was difficult; it led through
the passes of Piedmont and Mont Cenis. Early, while it
was still dark, they left Bardonecchia, so as to cross the
Alps before nightfall. The mules clattered their hoofs and
jangled their bells as they clambered along a narrow path
skirting the ravine. Spring had descended upon the
southern valleys, but up here winter reigned supreme.
The morning was just breaking; against the faintly tinted sky
the Alps shone as if lighted by internal fire. Leonardo,
wishing to see more of the mountains, left his beast, and with
Francesco followed a steeper path at a little distance from
the mule track. Perfect stillness surrounded them, only
interrupted by the distant long-drawn roar of an avalanche.
They scrambled higher, Leonardo leaning on the young
man's arm. Francesco remembered the descent of the iron-mine
when the Master had carried him, now it was he who
supported the Master.
</p><p>
'Oh, Messer Leonardo!' he cried suddenly, pointing to the
ravine below, 'look at the valley of the Dora! We see it
for the last time! We are almost at the summit, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
shall not see it again! Yon lies all Lombardy! Italy!' he
cried, his eyes wet with conflicting emotions; and he repeated,
'Lombardy! Italy! For the last time!'
</p><p>
The Master's face remained unmoved. He looked, then
turned silently and pressed onward towards the snows.
Forgetting his weariness, he now walked so quickly that
Francesco, who had lingered bidding farewell, was left behind.
</p><p>
'Nay, Master, whither go you?' he cried. 'There is no
path there; you can ascend no higher. I pray you take
heed!'
</p><p>
But Leonardo went on, higher and higher, his step firm
and light, as if his feet were winged.
</p><p>
Against the pale sky the icy masses towered one above the
other; a stupendous wall raised by God between two worlds.
They beckoned to Leonardo and drew him up and onwards.
It seemed as if behind them rose the last secret,&mdash;which
alone could satisfy his soul. Divided from him by impassable
gulfs, they appeared near, almost within touch. They looked
at him as the dead look at the living; they smiled at him
with the smile of Monna Lisa.
</p><p>
His pale face lighted with the same glow that was shining
upon the mountains and the ice. To him the thoughts of
death and of Monna Lisa were now but one.</p>

<p>In the heart of France, overhanging the Loire, stood the
royal castle of Amboise. It was built of stone, mellow in
colour as the bloom on a golden plum, which in the pale blues
and greens of the fading sunset gleamed soft as a floating
cloud. From the square tower the view extended over a
forest of primeval oak, beyond the broad meadows flanking
the river. In the early summer they were brilliant with
poppies invading the azure lines of the flax. Damp mists
hung over the valley, dark poplars and silvery willows stood
in long rows. It resembled the plain of Lombardy: only the
rivers were unlike each other:&mdash;the Adda, a torrent, passionate,
storm-tossed, young; the Loire, quiet and slow,
gliding gently over shallows, wearied and very old.
</p><p>
At the foot of the castle clustered the peaked roofs of the
town, slated, black, smooth and shining in the sun, and
among them massive brick chimneys. The streets, narrow,
winding, and sunless, belonged to the Middle Ages. Everywhere,
under all cornices and along all water-pipes, at the
angles of the windows, door-frames, lintels, were small stone
figures&mdash;jolly friars with flagons, rosaries and wooden sandals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
grave doctors of theology, thrifty citizens with fat purses
hugged to their breasts. The same types were to be seen
to-day walking the city streets; all here was <i>bourgeois</i>, prosperous,
conventional, pious, and cold.
</p><p>
When the king came to Amboise for the hunting, the
little town changed its aspect. The streets grew noisy with
the baying of dogs, the champing of horses, the blare of
trumpets. Music resounded nightly from the palace, and its
walls shone red with the flaring of torches. The king gone,
silence descended again upon the streets, the palace was like
an abode of the dead; no human step nor voice, save at
mass-time on Sundays, and in the spring evenings when the
children sang the old song of St. Denis under apple-trees
which showered rosy petals on their heads. Night fell, the
song was hushed, the children went away, and again there
was silence; such silence as made audible the measured beat
of the clock over the gate of the Horloge Tower, and the cry
of the wild swans far away on the sand-banks of the Loire.
</p><p>
Half a league from the castle, on the road to the Mill of
St. Thomas, was a small château called Cloux, once the
residence of the royal armourer. It was surrounded partly
by a high wall, partly by a stream; in front of the house was
a meadow, and a tangle of willows, alders, and hazel bushes
descending to the river. The pink walls of the château were
sharply defined against a background of chestnuts and elms;
the windows and doors ornamented by a dog-tooth moulding
in yellow Touraine stone. It was a small building with a
high-pitched slatted roof; a tiny chapel on the right of the
main entrance, and an octagonal tower, in which was a
winding-stair, made it resemble a villa. Rebuilt forty years
earlier, the outside was still new, cheerful, and inviting.
</p><p>
This little château Francis <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> assigned as lodging to
Leonardo da Vinci.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The king received the artist with cordiality, and talked
long with him of his works, past and future, respectfully
saluting him as 'father' and 'teacher.'
</p><p>
Leonardo proposed to remodel the castle of Amboise, also
to construct an immense canal, which, converting the barren
marshes into a luxuriant garden, should connect the Loire
and the Saône at Macon, and thus open a new route from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
Northern Europe to the Mediterranean. In this wise he
thought to benefit a foreign country by those gifts of knowledge
which his fatherland had contemned. The king was
pleased by the project, and at once Leonardo set out to
explore the locality, studying the soil of the Sologne near
Romorantin, the tributaries of the Loire and the Cher, the
level of the waters, the topography of the whole district.
</p><p>
One day he visited Loches, a small town to the south of
Amboise, where was the castle in which Ludovico Il Moro,
Duke of Lombardy, had been incarcerated for eight years.
The old warden told Leonardo how Il Moro had once made
his escape, by hiding in a cart loaded with straw; not knowing
the roads, however, he had lost his way in the forest, and
next day had been easily recaptured. His last years had been
spent in pious meditation, in prayer, and in the study of
Dante's <i>Commedia</i>, the only book he had been allowed to
bring out of Italy. At fifty he was a feeble wrinkled old
man; only at rare intervals did his eyes flash, when rumours
reached him of grave political changes. He died in May
1508 after a short illness.
</p><p>
The warden told further how Ludovico had, a few months
before his death, devised a pastime for himself; had begged
for brushes and paints and had decorated the walls and
arches of his prison. Leonardo found traces of his work
on the damp and mouldy plaster; involved patterns, stripes
and bars; stars and crosses; red on a white, yellow on a blue
ground; in the middle, the helmeted head of a warrior,
probably himself, thus inscribed in broken French, '<i>Je porte
en prison pour ma devise que je m'arme de pacience par force de
peines que l'on me fait porter.</i>'
</p><p>
Another sentence ran all round the ceiling; it began with
huge letters: '<i>Celui qui</i>,' then, space failing, continued in
characters small and cramped, '<i>net pas contan</i>.' Reading these
piteous inscriptions and looking at the clumsy drawings,
Leonardo remembered how Il Moro had smiled admiringly
on the swans in the moat of the fortress at Milan. 'Perhaps,'
thought he, 'the love of beauty which is certainly in his soul
will justify him before the tribunal of the Most High.'
</p><p>
Meditating on the fall of the hapless duke, he remembered
also what he had been told of the fate of another of
his patrons, Cæsar Borgia. Julius <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span> had treacherously
handed Cæsar over to his enemies, who had carried him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
Spain and confined him in the tower of Medina del Campo.
Daring and ingenious, he escaped by means of a rope let
down from his prison window. The jailers had time to sever
the rope; he fell and was seriously hurt, but none the less
crawled to the horse provided by an accomplice, and rode
away. He went to Pampeluna to the court of his brother-in-law,
the King of Navarre, where he took service as a condottiere.
</p><p>
Consternation spread through Italy; the pope trembled;
and ten thousand ducats were set upon the head of the
fugitive. On a wintry night of 1507 in an encounter with
the French mercenaries under Beaumont, Cæsar was deserted
by his followers, and driven into the dry bed of a river, where,
like an animal at bay, he defended himself with desperate
courage. At last he fell, pierced by twenty wounds. The
mercenaries tore the splendid trappings from the dead
warrior, and left him naked where he had fallen. Later,
when the Navarrese came to seek him they knew him not;
only Juanito, his little page, recognised his lord by reason of
his great love for him; and flinging himself on the corpse he
embraced it sobbing. Beautiful was the dead face, upturned
to the heavens; and it seemed he had died even as he had
lived, fearless, and without knowledge of remorse. Madonna
Lucrezia, Duchess of Ferrara, wept ever for her brother; and
when she died they found a hair shirt chafing her tender body.
And Cæsar's youthful widow, Charlotte d'Albret, who in the
few days she had been with him had come to love him as a
very Griselda, having learned of his death, retired to perpetual
seclusion in the castle of La Motte Feuill&#233;e, buried in the
heart of a forest, where only winds rustled the dry leaves;
nor used to leave her chamber, hung with perpetual mourning,
save to distribute alms, imploring pensioners to pray
for the soul of Cæsar.
</p><p>
And likewise the duke's subjects in Romagna, husbandmen
and half-savage shepherds from the valleys of the Apennine,
kept most grateful memory of him. Long they refused to
believe him dead, but waited for him as a god who should
some day return and establish justice in the land, cast down
the tyrants, and defend the poor. Beggars who wandered
from village to village chanted 'the woeful lament for the Duca
Valentino,' in which was the line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Fe' cose estreme, ma senza misura.'</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
Thus Leonardo mused on these two men, Ludovico and
Cesare, whose lives had been signalled by great events, yet
had passed away like shadows, leaving no trace. And he
felt, after all, that his own life, spent in lofty contemplation,
had been at least as fruitful.
</p><p>
Thus thinking, he ceased to murmur at the untowardness
of Fate.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Like the majority of Leonardo's projects, the making of
the Sologne canal ended in nothing. Timorous counsellors
persuaded Francis of the impracticability of the enterprise.
His Majesty grew cold, was disenchanted, and soon forgot
all about it; Leonardo found that the King of France was
no more to be relied upon than Il Moro, Soderini, or Leo <span class="smcap lowercase">X</span>.
He resolved to abandon all hope of enriching mankind by
the treasures of his knowledge, and to retire for the rest of his
life into solitude.
</p><p>
In the spring of 1517 he returned to Cloux, sick of fever
contracted in the marshes of the Sologne. He recovered
partially, and by the summer season had strength sufficient
to leave his room, and leaning on Francesco's arm to walk
daily as far as to the woods. Here he would sit in the
shadow of the trees, his pupil at his feet. Sometimes
Francesco read to him; sometimes he was content merely to
enjoy the sights and sounds of peaceful nature, gazing at the
sky, the leaves, the stones, the grasses, the golden moss on
the huge tree-trunks, as if bidding them all a last farewell. A
sorrowful presentiment, a great pity for the Master oppressed
Francesco's heart. Silently he would touch Leonardo's hand
with his lips; and then feel that trembling hand laid upon
his head in a mournful caress, which deepened his sense
of a coming doom.
</p><p>
At this time the Master began a strange picture.
</p><p>
Sheltered by overhanging rocks, in a cool shadow among
flowering grasses, sat a god; he was long-haired and fair as a
woman, but languid and pale; his head crowned with vine-leaves,
a spotted skin round his loins, a thyrsus in his hand.
He sat with legs crossed and seemed to be listening, a hinting
smile on his lips, his finger pointed in the direction whence
came the sound, perhaps the song of Mænads, perhaps the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
voice of great Pan, that thrilling sound from which all living
things must flee.
</p><p>
In Boltraffio's casket Leonardo had found an amethyst
gem, doubtless a gift from Monna Cassandra, with an
engraving of Dionysus. There were also stray leaves from
Euripides' tragedy, the <i>Bacchæ</i>, translated from the Greek
and copied out by Giovanni. Many times had Leonardo
read these fragments; amongst them the address of Pentheus
to the unknown god.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Ha! of thy form thou art not ill-favoured, stranger,</p>
<p>&nbsp;For woman's tempting!</p>
<p>&nbsp;No wrestler thou, as show thy flowing locks</p>
<p>&nbsp;Down thy cheek floating, fraught with all desire;</p>
<p>&nbsp;And white from heedful tendance is thy skin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Smit by no sunshafts, but made wan by shade,</p>
<p>&nbsp;While thou dost hunt desire with beauty's lure.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>And the chorus of Bacchantes, answering the impious king,
extol Dionysus as 'the most terrible, the most beneficent of
gods, who giveth to mortals the drunkenness of ecstasy.'
</p><p>
On the same page, side by side with the verses from
Euripides, Giovanni had copied verses from the Bible.
</p><p>
Leaving his Bacchus unfinished, Leonardo began another
picture, still more strange, of St. John the Baptist. He
worked at it more continuously and more rapidly than was
his wont, as if feeling that his days were numbered, that his
strength was every day declining, and that now or never he
must give expression to that mystery which all his life he had
hidden from men,&mdash;even from himself.
</p><p>
Soon the picture was sufficiently advanced for the conception
to be clear. The background was dark, recalling the
gloom of that cavern he had once described to Monna Lisa
as the occasion both of curiosity and of fear. Yet the dimness
was not impenetrable, but blent with light, melting into it as
smoke dissolves into sunlight, as distant music vibrates away
into silence. And between the darkness and the perfect light
appeared what at first seemed a phantom, but presently
snowed more distinct than life itself; the face and figure of a
naked youth, womanish, seductively beautiful, recalling the
words of Pentheus.
</p><p>
But instead of the leopard's skin he wore a garment of
camel's hair; instead of the thrysus he carried a cross.
Smiling, with bent head, as if listening, all expectation, all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
curiosity, yet half afraid, he pointed with one hand to the
cross, with the other to himself, and on his lips the words
seemed to tremble:&mdash;
</p><p>
'There cometh one after me whose shoe's-latchet I am not
worthy to unloose.'</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3>IV</h3>

<p>After a tedious morning spent in touching for the king's
evil, Francis <span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span> felt a desire for something beautiful to divert
his mind from the spectacle of deformity and sickness. He
resolved to visit Leonardo's studio. Accordingly, with a few
attendants, he presented himself at Cloux.
</p><p>
All day the painter had worked at his Baptist. His room
was large and cold, with a brick floor and a high-raftered
ceiling. The last slanting rays of the sun streamed in
through the narrow window; and Leonardo was hastening to
finish his day's task before the coming on of twilight. When
he heard voices and footsteps under the window, he said to
Melzi:&mdash;
</p><p>
'I admit no one. Say I am ill.'
</p><p>
Francesco went out obediently to stop the intruders; but
seeing the king he bowed respectfully and threw open the
doors. Leonardo had barely time to cover the portrait of
La Gioconda; this he always did if he expected strangers.
</p><p>
Francis entered; he was richly but gaudily dressed, with
excess of jewellery and gold trimmings. He was twenty-four
years of age, well built, tall and strong, majestic, and of
agreeable manners. Yet there was something displeasing in
his face, something at once sensual and sly, suggestive of a
satyr.
</p><p>
He refused to allow Leonardo to kneel, bowed respectfully
himself, and even embraced the aged painter.
</p><p>
'It is long since we saw each other, Maître L&#233;onard,' he
said. 'How is your health? Do you paint much? Have
you done many new pictures? What is that one?' and he
pointed to the curtained Monna Lisa.
</p><p>
'An old portrait, sire, which your Majesty has already
seen.'
</p><p>
'Let me see it again. The oftener one sees your pictures
the more one admires them.'
</p><p>
The painter hesitated, but to his annoyance a courtier
removed the veil, and La Gioconda was revealed.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
The king, throwing himself on a chair, gazed long without
a word. 'Marvellous!' he exclaimed at last. 'That is the
fairest woman I ever saw! Who is she?'
</p><p>
'Madonna Lisa, wife of a Florentine citizen.'
</p><p>
'Did you paint it lately?'
</p><p>
'Ten years ago.'
</p><p>
'Is she still beautiful?'
</p><p>
'Sire, she is dead.'
</p><p>
'Maître L&#233;onard da Vinci,' said Saint Gelais, the court
poet, 'worked five years at yon portrait, and has left it
unfinished&mdash;so at least he avers.'
</p><p>
'Unfinished?' cried the king. 'I pray you, what does it
lack? She seems alive&mdash;on the point to speak. You are
enviable, Maître L&#233;onard! Five years with that woman!
Had she not died, I trow, you would not have finished it yet.'
He laughed, and the resemblance to a satyr increased. It
never occurred to him that Monna Lisa might have been a
faithful wife.
</p><p>
'I see, sir, you have a pretty taste in women,' resumed His
Majesty gaily. 'What shoulders! what a bosom! And one
may guess at further beauties!'
</p><p>
Leonardo remained silent; he grew pale, and his eyes were
fixed on the ground.
</p><p>
'To paint such a likeness,' continued the king, ''tis not
enough to be an artist; you must fathom all the secrets of a
woman's heart, that labyrinth, that tangle, impossible to the
devil himself. Yon lady seems modest; she folds her hands
like a nun; but wait a bit; guess what is in her heart.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Souvent femme varie</p>
<p>&nbsp;Bien fol qui s'y fie!'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Leonard stepped aside, as if to move another picture to the
light, and Saint Gelais whispered scandal to his master concerning
Leonardo's supposed tastes in matters of the heart.
</p><p>
Francis seemed surprised, but shrugged his shoulders
indulgently, and turned to an unfinished cartoon on an easel
near the portrait.
</p><p>
'What is this?'
</p><p>
'Bacchus, methinks,' said the poet, pointing to the thyrsus.
</p><p>
'And this?'
</p><p>
'It would seem, Bacchus again,' said Saint Gelais.
</p><p>
'The hair and the breast are like a girl,' said the king; 'it
has the same smile as La Gioconda.'
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
'A hermaphrodite then,' returned the poet; and repeated
Plato's fable of the original men-women, and the origin of the
passion of Love. 'Maître L&#233;onard would fain restore the
primitive type,' he concluded mockingly.
</p><p>
Francis turned to the painter.
</p><p>
'Resolve our doubts, Master,' he said; 'is it Bacchus or a
hermaphrodite?'
</p><p>
'Sire,' said Leonardo, reddening, 'it is St. John the Baptist.'
</p><p>
The king shook his head in bewilderment. This mixture
of the sacred and the profane seemed blasphemous to him,
yet rather attractive. Not that the blasphemy mattered;
every one knows that painters have queer fancies!
</p><p>
'I will buy both pictures,' he said; 'the Bacchus&mdash;I mean
the Baptist, and Lisa la Gioconda. What is the price?'
</p><p>
'Your Majesty,' began the painter, embarrassed, 'they are
not yet finished.'
</p><p>
'Tut, man! St. John you can finish at once, and as for
Lisa, I will not have her touched. I want her with me at
once, hear you? Tell me the price, and fear not. I will not
try to cheapen her.'
</p><p>
What was Leonardo to say to this frivolous coarse man?
How explain what the portrait was to its painter, and why no
price could induce him to give it up?
</p><p>
'You will not speak? Then I will name a price myself.
Three thousand crowns? How say you? 'Tis not enough?
Three and a half?'
</p><p>
'Sire,' implored the artist, his voice shaking; 'I can assure
you&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
'Well! well! Maître L&#233;onard, four thousand?'
</p><p>
A murmur of astonishment came from the courtiers. Not
Lorenzo de' Medici himself had ever set such a price
upon a picture. Leonardo raised his eyes in unutterable
confusion. He was ready to fall on his knees, to beg as men
beg for their lives, that he might not be robbed of La
Gioconda. Francis took his embarrassment for gratitude,
rose to leave, and as a farewell, again embraced the painter.
</p><p>
'Then that's settled. Four thousand crowns, and the
money is ready for you when you choose. To-morrow I shall
send for her. Make yourself easy. I will hang her with
such honour as shall content you. I know her value! I will
preserve her for posterity!'
</p><p>
When the king had gone, Leonardo sank into a chair,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
looking at his picture, scarce believing what had happened.
Absurd, childish devices suggested themselves to him: he
would hide the portrait; he would refuse to give it up,
though threatened with capital punishment. He would
send Melzi to Italy with it&mdash;nay, he would flee himself.
</p><p>
Night fell. Francesco looked several times into the room,
but did not venture to speak. Leonardo still sat before
Monna Lisa, his face pale and rigid as that of a corpse.
At midnight he went into Francesco's room.
</p><p>
'Get up. We must go to the castle. I have to see the
king.'
</p><p>
'Master, it is late. You are weary. You have not the
strength. Let us wait for the morrow.'
</p><p>
'No, it must be now. Light me the lantern, and come
with me. If you will not, I will go alone.'
</p><p>
Francesco rose and dressed himself, and they went together
to the castle.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>V</h3>

<p>The walk took a quarter of an hour; the path was steep
and badly paved. Leonardo moved slowly, leaning on the
young man's arm. It was a warm and starless night, black
as the pit. The boughs of the trees swayed painfully under
the gusts of wind. There were lights in the castle windows,
and music made itself heard. The king was supping late
with a small company, and amusing himself by making the
young ladies of the court drink from a silver cup chased with
obscene figures. Among these ladies was his sister Marguerite,
called 'The Pearl of Pearls,' and celebrated for her
beauty and erudition. 'The art of pleasing was more
important to her than daily bread,' so said her admirers. At
heart, however, she was indifferent to all except her brother,
to whom she was devotedly attached. His weaknesses seemed
to her charms, his vices strength, his faun's mask the countenance
of Apollo. For him she declared herself ready not
merely to scatter the ashes of her body to the wind, but to
sell her immortal soul. Francis abused her affection, for he
made use of her not only in difficulties and dangers, but
also in his amorous adventures.
</p><p>
Leonardo's coming was announced; and Francis, having
sent for him to the supper-room, advanced with his sister to
greet him. The cavaliers and court-ladies watched the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
artist's entry with glances half respectful, half contemptuous.
The tall old man, with the long hair, the melancholy face,
the nervous manner, seemed to have dropped from an alien
sphere, and sent a chill through the company as if he had
come out of a snowstorm.
</p><p>
'Ah! Maître L&#233;onard!' cried the king with his customary
cordiality, 'you are a rare guest. What shall we offer you?
You eat no flesh, I know; but you will partake of sweetmeats
and fruit?'
</p><p>
'I thank your Majesty. Sire, you will excuse me; I am
fain to speak a few words with your Majesty.'
</p><p>
Francis led him aside, and asked if Marguerite might be
present.
</p><p>
'I venture to hope that her Highness will intercede for
me,' said Leonardo with a bow. Then he spread out his
hands to the sovereign. 'I come, sire, about my picture,
which your Majesty has desired to buy&mdash;the portrait of
Monna Lisa.'
</p><p>
'Had we not agreed upon the price?' asked the king.
</p><p>
'I come not about money,' said Leonardo.
</p><p>
'Then what is the matter?'
</p><p>
The painter felt again that to speak of La Gioconda to this
indifferent affable young monarch was impossible. Nevertheless
he forced himself to say:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Sire, be merciful to me. Do not take this portrait from
me. It shall be yours; I ask no money for it. Only leave it
with me till&mdash;my death.'
</p><p>
He paused, looking entreatingly at Marguerite.
</p><p>
The king shrugged his shoulders and frowned.
</p><p>
'Sire!' said the young lady, 'grant the prayer of Maître
L&#233;onard. He deserves it! Be compassionate!'
</p><p>
'What, Madame Marguerite, are you on his side? A plot,
I declare, a plot! a plot!'
</p><p>
Laying her hand on her brother's shoulder, she whispered:&mdash;'Do
you not see? He still loves her!'
</p><p>
'But she is dead!'
</p><p>
'Do men never love the dead? You said yourself she
lived in her portrait! Leave him his memorial of her. Do
not afflict the old man!'
</p><p>
Francis had a dim recollection of having somewhere heard
of eternal unions of soul, of fidelity, of love that had no
grossness in it. He felt inspired by magnanimity.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
'You have a sweet intercessor, Maître L&#233;onard. Be of
good cheer. I will do as you ask; only remember the
picture belongs to me, and you shall receive the money at
once.'
</p><p>
Something wistful and plaintive in Leonardo's eyes touched
the king, and he tapped him good-naturedly.
</p><p>
'Fear not! I give you my word! None shall part you
from your Lisa!'
</p><p>
Marguerite smiled and her eyes shone. She gave her hand
to the painter, who kissed it fervently and in silence.
</p><p>
The band struck up and dancing began. No one thought
any more of the uncourtly guest, who had come in like a
shadow and vanished again into the starless night.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>As soon as the king went away the usual quiet settled
upon Amboise. Leonardo worked on at his St. John, but as
the picture advanced it became more difficult, and his
progress was less rapid. Sometimes in the twilight he
would lift the veil from the portrait of Monna Lisa, gaze
long at it, and then at St. John, which stood beside it.
Apparently he was comparing the two pictures. Francesco,
watching breathlessly, fancied at those times that the
expression of the two faces, the woman's and the youth's,
mysteriously changed; they stood out from the canvas like
apparitions, and under the fixed gaze of the painter lived
with a supernatural life. St. John grew like Monna Lisa,
and like Leonardo himself, even as a son resembles his
parents.
</p><p>
Meantime the Master's health was declining. Melzi
begged him to rest and leave his work, but this he resolutely
refused to do. One day, in the autumn of 1518, he was
greatly indisposed. He desisted earlier than usual from his
work, and asked Francesco to help him to his bedroom.
The winding stair was steep, and often of late he had been
unable to ascend it without assistance. So Francesco supported
him, and he went up slowly, halting frequently to
recover his breath. Suddenly he staggered and fell into the
young man's arms. Francesco called the old servant Battista
Villanis. Together they lifted the Master and carried him
to his bedroom.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
He lay six weeks in bed, refusing all medical advice
according to his wont. His right side was paralysed, his
right arm useless. The winter found him better, but his
recovery was slow. He was ambidextrous, but required
both hands at once for his work. With the left he drew,
with the right he painted; and he maintained that it was this
division of labour which had given him superiority over
other painters. He feared now that painting had become
impossible to him. In the early days of December he rose
from his bed, and before long came downstairs to his
painting-room, but did not resume his work.
</p><p>
One day at the hour of siesta, Francesco, not finding him
in the upper rooms, cautiously opened the studio door and
looked in. Of late Leonardo had been increasingly disinclined
to society; he spent many hours alone, and would
allow no one to enter unbidden. Francesco, peeping now
through the half-opened door, saw him standing before the
picture of St. John, and trying to paint with his disabled
hand. His face was distorted by the anguish of effort, the
corners of his mouth drooped, the brows were contracted,
and the strands of grey hair, falling over his forehead, were
bathed in sweat. His fingers would not obey him, and the
brush shook in the hands of the great Master as in the hand
of a clumsy beginner. With bated breath Francesco watched
this last struggle between the living spirit and the dying body.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>That year the winter was very severe. Drifting ice broke
the bridges of the Loire, people were frozen on the roads,
wolves came into the suburbs of the town, and prowled even
under the windows of the château. One morning Francesco
found a half-frozen swallow on the verandah and carried it to
Leonardo, who revived it with the warmth of his breath, and
established it in a cage near the fire, meaning to restore it to
liberty in the spring. The Master no longer attempted to
paint, and had hidden the unfinished picture with his brushes
and paints in the darkest corner of the studio. The days
went by in idleness. Sometimes the notary visited them and
talked of the harvests, the salt tax, and the comparative
merits of Languedoc and Limousin sheep. Sometimes
Francesco's confessor came, Fra Guglielmo, an Italian by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
birth, but long settled at Amboise, a simple pleasant old
man, who could tell stories about the Florence of his youth
which made Leonardo laugh.
</p><p>
The early twilight came on, and the visitors took their
departure. Then for hours at a time Leonardo would pace
up and down the room, occasionally glancing at Astro. Now
more than ever the cripple seemed to him a living reproach,
the mockery of the one great aim of his life, the making of
wings for men. Astro sat in a corner, his feet drawn up
under him, winding long strips of linen on a stick, whittling
sticks, carving tops, or with his eyes blinking he would rock
himself slowly and, smiling, sing his unchanging song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Cucurlu! Curlu!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Eagles and cranes,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Up they flew!'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>At last it became quite dark, and silence descended upon the
house. Out of doors the boughs of the old trees creaked and
roared in the storm, and the roar was like the voice of
malignant giants. The eerie howling of wolves was heard in
the outskirts of the forest. Francesco piled logs on the fire,
and Leonardo sat down beside it. The young man played
on the lute and could sing very pleasantly. He tried to
dispel the Master's melancholy by his music; once he sang
him an old song composed by Lorenzo Il Magnifico for the
'Mask of Bacchus and Ariadne,' a favourite with Leonardo,
who had known it in his youth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'Quant' è bella giovinezza</p>
<p>&nbsp;Ma sen fugge tuttavia?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Chi vuol esser lieto, sia;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Di doman non v'è certezza.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Master listened, greatly moved; he remembered the
summer night, the dark shadows, the brilliant moonlight in
the lonely street, the sounds of the lute from the marble
loggia, the same tender love-song. And he remembered,
too, his thoughts of La Gioconda. Francesco, sitting at the
old man's feet, looked up and saw that tears were falling
from the fading eyes.
</p><p>
Sometimes Leonardo would read over his old diaries, and
occasionally he still wrote in them, but of the subject which
now chiefly occupied his thoughts&mdash;Death.
</p><p>
'Thou see'st that thy hope and thy desire to return to
thy native land, and to thy old life, is like the desire of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
moth for the flame, and that Man (who, ceaseless in desire,
joyous in impatience, ever awaits a new spring, and thinketh
that his desire is slow in its fulfilment) does not know that he
expecteth but his own destruction and his end. But this
expectation is the quintessence of nature, the soul of the
elements, and finding itself in the soul of man, it is the desire
to return from the body unto Him who made it.'
</p><p>
'In nature nothing exists but Force and Movement; and
force is the volition of happiness, the eternal striving of the
universe after final equilibrium and the Prime Mover.'
</p><p>
'Every part desires to be united with its whole that it may
escape imperfection.'
</p><p>
'As the day well spent gives pleasant dreams, life well
lived shall give a happy death.'
</p><p>
'Every evil leaves bitterness in the memory, except the
greatest evil, which is death, for it destroys the memory
together with the life.'
</p><p>
'When I thought I was learning to live, I was but learning
how to die.'
</p><p>
'The outward necessity of nature corresponds with the
outward necessity of reason: everything is reasonable, all is
good, because all is necessary.'
</p><p>
Thus his reason justified death, the will of the Prime
Mover; yet in the depth of his heart something rebelled.
</p><p>
Once he dreamed that he awoke in a coffin buried alive
under the earth, and with desperate resolution and panting
for breath he strove to raise the lid of his prison.
</p><p>
Next morning he told Francesco of his desire that he
should lie unburied till the first signs of decomposition
should show themselves. He still loved life with a blind
unreasoning love, still clung to it and dreaded death as a
black pit into which that day or the next he would fall with
a cry of the utmost terror. All the consolations of reason,
all he had said of divine necessity and the will of the Prime
Mover, vanished like smoke before this shrinking of the flesh.
He would have relinquished his immortality for one ray of
earthly sunshine, one waft of the spring, for the perfume
of expanding leaves, for a bunch of yellow flowers from the
Monte Albano, where he had been a happy child.
</p><p>
At night, when he could not sleep, Francesco would read
to him from the Gospels. Never had they seemed to him so
new, so rare in excellence, so little understood of men.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
Some sayings, as he thought out their meaning, deepened for
him like wells.
</p><p>
"Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." Was this
indeed the answer to the question of his whole life, 'Shall
not men have wings?'
</p><p>
"And having ended all his temptation, the devil departed
from him <i>for a season</i>." What did that mean? When did
the devil return to him again?
</p><p>
Words which might have seemed to him full of the greatest
error, contrary to experience and natural law, still did not
repel him.
</p><p>
'If ye have faith as a grain of mustard-seed, ye shall say
unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it
shall remove.'
</p><p>
He had always thought that the final knowledge and the
final faith would lead by different paths to the same goal, the
blending of outward and inward necessity, the will of man
and the will of God. Yet was not the sting of the words in
the fact that <i>to have faith</i>, even as a grain of mustard-seed,
was more difficult than to see the mountain remove unto
yonder place?
</p><p>
But there was a saying of Christ's still more enigmatical:
"I thank thee, Father, that thou hast hid these things from the
wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes." How
reconcile this with the injunction, "Be ye wise as serpents"?
</p><p>
And, again, "Consider the lilies of the field, they toil not
neither do they spin. Take no thought saying what shall we
eat or what shall we drink, for after all these things do the
Gentiles seek, and your heavenly Father knoweth that ye
have need of all these things."
</p><p>
Leonardo recalled his discoveries and inventions, the
machines for giving men power over nature, and asked
himself:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Is all this care for the body&mdash;what shall we eat and what
shall we drink, and the like&mdash;is it mammon worship? Is
there nothing in human toil, in knowledge, but the mere profit?
Is knowledge like Martha, who is careful and troubled about
many things, but not about the one thing needful? Is love
like Mary, who has chosen the good part and sitteth at the
Master's feet?'
</p><p>
He knew by experience the temptations inseparable from
knowledge.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
It seemed to the dying man that he was already face to
face with the black, the dreadful pit, into which, if not to-day
then to-morrow, he too must fall with a last despairing cry:&mdash;
</p><p>
'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?'</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Sometimes of a morning, when he looked through the
frosted windows at the deep snow, the grey sky, the frozen
water, he thought the winter would never end. But in
February there came a breath of warmth. Drops trickled
noisily from the icicles at the sunny side of the houses, the
sparrows twittered, and the trees were girt with dark circles
where the snow had melted, the buds swelled, and patches of
blue sky were seen among the clouds. Francesco placed
his master's chair in a sunny window, and for hours the old
man would sit quite still with bent head, his wasted hands
resting upon his knees. The swallow which had been
rescued from the first frost now flew and circled about the
room, perched on Leonardo's shoulder, and allowed herself
to be handled and kissed on the head. Suddenly she would
start up and again fly round the ceiling with impatient cries
as if scenting the spring. He followed every turn of her
lithe body, every movement of her pinions. The old idea of
wings for men stirred within him.
</p><p>
One day he opened a large chest which contained his
manuscript-books, stray drawings and sketches, chiefly
mechanical, jottings from his two hundred 'Books of Nature.'
All his life he had been meaning to bring order into this
chaos, to sort the fragments and unite them in one whole,
one great 'Book of the Universe.' He knew that among
them were ideas and discoveries which could materially
shorten the labours of those men who were to come after
him. He knew also that he had delayed too long, that it was
now too late, that all his sowing would fail of fruit, that all
his scientific material would perish like the <i>Cenacolo</i>, the
Colossus, the 'Battle of Anghiari.' And this, because in
science as in art he had only desired with a wingless desire,
had begun and not finished, had accomplished nothing. He
foresaw that men would seek what he had found, would
discover what he had already discovered, would walk in his
paths, in his very steps; but would pass him by, would forget
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
him as though he had never lived. In the chest he found a
small manuscript-book, yellow with age, and entitled 'Birds.'
Of late years he had scarcely occupied himself with the
flying-machine, though he still often thought of it. To-day,
watching the flight of his tame swallow, a new idea had come
to him, a new design had perfected itself in his mind, and he
determined to make a last attempt, indulging the last vain
hope that by the finally successful making of wings for men
the whole labour of his life would be justified.
</p><p>
He entered on this new task with the same resolution,
with the same feverish haste which he had expended on
the St. John. Ceasing to brood over death, conquering his
weakness, forgetting his food and his sleep, he sat for whole
days and nights over his calculations and his drawings.
Francesco watching him sometimes feared this was not work
but the delirium of a sick mind. With increasing alarm he
noticed how the Master's face became distorted under the
desperate effort of will, under the violent desire for the
impossible&mdash;which men may not seek with impunity.
</p><p>
The week went by and Francesco never left him, not even
to sleep. But a night came when deadly weariness overcame
the youth; he threw himself on a chair by the fire and
dozed. The morning came grey through the window, the
swallow wakened and chirruped. Leonardo was still sitting
at his work-table, a pen in his hand; he was greatly bent, his
head almost touching the paper. Suddenly he trembled
strangely, the pen dropped and his head fell. He made an
effort to rise, tried to call Francesco, but could make no
sound. Heavily and helplessly he rolled with his whole
weight upon the table and overturned it. Melzi, awakened
by the crash, sprang to his feet, to find the Master lying on
the floor, his candle extinguished, his papers scattered, the
terrified swallow flapping her wings against the rafters overhead.
He realised that this was a second stroke.
</p><p>
For some days Leonardo lay unconscious, making occasional
mutterings, always of mathematics. When he came to
himself he at once asked for his sketches of the flying-machine.
</p><p>
'Nay, Master. Ask of me anything else, but I cannot let
you work till you have mended somewhat,' replied Francesco.
</p><p>
'Where have you put my sketches?' he demanded,
angrily.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
'I have locked them in the attic.'
</p><p>
'Give me the key.'
</p><p>
'Nay, Master, what can you do with the key?'
</p><p>
'Give it me this instant.'
</p><p>
Francesco hesitated; the invalid's eyes flashed with wrath.
Not to excite him, the young man gave the key. Leonardo
hid it under his pillow and seemed satisfied. His recovery
after this was more rapid than could have been hoped. In
the beginning of April he was able again to play chess with
Fra Guglielmo.
</p><p>
One night Francesco, sleeping on his customary bench by
the Master's side, started up in alarm, for he could not hear
Leonardo's usually heavy breathing. The night-light had
been extinguished; he relit it hastily, and found the invalid's
bed empty; he waked Villanis and they visited all the rooms
on that floor, but Leonardo was not there. Francesco was
going downstairs, when he remembered the sketches hidden
in the attic. He hastened thither and found the door
unlocked. Leonardo, half-dressed, was seated on the floor
before an old box, which he was using as a table. By the
light of a tallow candle he was writing, while he muttered
rapidly as if delirious. His glowing eyes, his matted hair, his
brows violently contracted, his sunken helpless mouth, his
whole appearance was so strange and alarming to Francesco
that for a few minutes he dared not enter.
</p><p>
Suddenly Leonardo snatched up a pencil and drew it
across a page of figures so violently that it broke. Then he
looked round, saw his pupil, rose and tottered towards him.
</p><p>
'I told you, Francesco,' he said quickly and bitterly, 'that
I should soon make an end. Now I have finished. So have
no fear, I shall not work any more. 'Tis enough. I have
grown old and dull; more dull than Astro. I know nothing
at all. What I have known I forget. Is it for me to think
of wings? To the devil even with the wings!'
</p><p>
And seizing his papers furiously he tore and trampled
them.
</p><p>
From that day his health grew worse. He returned to his
bed, and Melzi foresaw that he would not again rise from
it. Sometimes for whole days he lay in a trance.
</p><p>
Francesco was devout, and whatever the Church taught he
believed without question. Alone of Leonardo's pupils he
had not fallen under the influence of those 'fatal spells';
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
that 'evil eye' attributed to the Master. Though Leonardo
did not observe the Church ceremonials, his young companion
divined by the instinct of love that he was not
impious. The lad did not try to penetrate further into the
great man's opinions. Now, however, the thought that he
might die unabsolved from errors, perhaps from heresies, was
torture to the pious youth. He was afraid to address the
Master on the subject, but he would have given his life to
save him.
</p><p>
One evening Leonardo, seeing his anxious face, asked him
what were his thoughts. Francesco answered with some
embarrassment.
</p><p>
'Fra Guglielmo came this morning and wanted to see you.
I told him it was impossible&mdash;&mdash;'
</p><p>
The Master looked at his young attendant and saw alarm,
entreaty, hope on his face.
</p><p>
'Francesco, this was not what you were thinking. Why
will you not tell me?'
</p><p>
The pupil was silent, his eyes downcast. Leonardo understood;
he turned away and frowned. He had always wished
to die as he had lived, in complete liberty; in the truth, so
far as he knew it. But he had compassion on Francesco.
Could he, in these last hours of his life, embitter a simple
heart, bring offences once more upon one of these 'little
ones'?
</p><p>
He looked again at his pupil; laid his wasted hand on the
lad's hand and said with a quiet smile:&mdash;
</p><p>
'My son, send to Fra Guglielmo and bid him come to-morrow.
I wish to confess and to communicate. Send also
for Maître Guillaume.'
</p><p>
Francesco did not answer&mdash;he kissed Leonardo's hand in
passionate gratitude.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>The next morning, Saturday in Passion Week, April 23rd,
Maître Guillaume the notary came, and Leonardo imparted
to him his last wishes. He bequeathed four hundred florins
to his brothers in token of reconciliation; to Francesco
Melzi he left his books, scientific apparatus, machines, manuscripts,
and the remainder of the salary due to him from the
royal treasury; to Battista Villanis, his household furniture,
and the half of the vineyard outside the walls of Milan; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
other half he left to his pupil Andrea Salaino. Maturina was
to have a dress of good black cloth, a cloth cap trimmed with
fur, and two ducats. Melzi was named executor, and the
ordering of the funeral was entrusted to him. Francesco was
solicitous that all should be arranged in a manner to contradict
popular slanders, and make it clear that the Master
had died a true son of the Catholic Church. Leonardo
assented to all he proposed.
</p><p>
Presently Fra Guglielmo came with the Holy Viaticum, and
Leonardo made his confession and received the Sacrament
'according to the rites of the Church'; 'in all humility and
submission to the will of God,' as the monk afterwards told
Francesco; adding that whatever might be said against the
Master he would be justified by the words of the Lord,
'Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.' All
day he suffered from breathlessness, but he survived the
night, and on the morning of Easter Sunday seemed a little
easier.
</p><p>
Francesco opened the window. Pigeons were flying in the
blue air, and the rustle of their flight mingled with the chime
of the Easter bells.
</p><p>
The dying man no longer heard nor saw what was passing
around him. He imagined great weights falling and rolling
on him and crushing him. With an effort he freed himself
and was flying upward on gigantic wings. Again the weights
fell, again he conquered them, and so on, again and again.
And each time the weight was heavier, the struggle to overcome
it more desperate; till at last he gave up the attempt, crying
aloud a despairing cry.
</p><p>
He resigned himself to defeat. And then immediately he
realised that the weights and the wings, the falling and the
flight were all one; 'above' and 'below' were the same, and
he was borne along on the waves of eternal motion gently as
in a mother's arms.
</p><p>
For some days longer his body lived, but he never recovered
consciousness. On the morning of May 2nd Francesco and
Fra Guglielmo noticed that his breathing had grown feebler.
The monk read the prayers for the dying; a little later, and
the young man had closed his eyes.
</p><p>
The face of the dead man changed but little; it wore the
expression, so frequent in his lifetime, of profound and quiet
attention.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
The windows were widely opened, and Francesco and the
two old servants were performing the last offices for the
corpse. Suddenly the tame swallow, which of late had been
forgotten, flew into the room, circled over the dead man, and
settled at last upon his folded hands.
</p><p>
He was buried at the monastery of St. Florentine, but the
exact site of his grave is unknown.
</p><p>
Writing to Florence to the Master's brothers Francesco
thus expressed himself:&mdash;
</p><p>
'I cannot tell the grief occasioned to me by the death of
him who was more to me than a father. Long as I live I
shall mourn him. He loved me with a great and tender love.
The whole world will grieve for the loss of a man whose like
Nature herself will not create again.
</p><p>
'May the Almighty God grant him everlasting peace!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span></p>

<h2>EPILOGUE</h2>

<p>Now it so happened that just at the time when Leonardo da
Vinci died, a certain young Russian courtier named Eutychius
came a second time to Amboise in the train of Karachiarov,
the Russian ambassador. On his journey this young courtier,
who brought a gift of gold and of priceless Persian falcons for
King Francis, visited Florence, and had seen the bas-relief on
the Campanile, which represented Dædalus experimenting
with waxen wings. It had given Leonardo in his boyhood
the first idea of Wings for Man; and now it was of interest
to the young Russian, who in his spare time, for pleasure,
was painting an ecclesiastical icon of 'The Winged Precursor.'
With vague and half-prophetic awe he contemplated the
contrast between the material wings constructed by Dædalus,
who was perhaps assisted by demons, and the spiritual wings&mdash;'upon
which pure souls rise to God'&mdash;of the 'Incarnate
Angel,' the Precursor, St. John the Baptist.
</p><p>
While at Amboise, Eutychius one day obtained leave to
visit the château of Cloux, where the deceased Master,
Leonardo da Vinci, had lived. The party was received by
Francesco Melzi, who showed them the studio and all it
contained. They inspected the strange instruments, the
apparatus for the study of the laws of sound, the great crystal
eye for experiments on sight, the diving-bell, the anatomical
drawings, the designs for engines of war. All this was
interesting; but for Eutychius the supreme attraction was
the broken frame of a wing resembling the pinion of a great
swallow. He learned from Melzi of its history and its purpose;
and strange thoughts rose in his breast as he remembered
Dædalus on the marble tower of Santa Maria del Fiore.
</p><p>
Presently he stood in bewilderment before the dead
Leonardo's picture of St. John the Baptist. The appearance
of the Forerunner was almost that of a woman; yet he carried
the reed cross, and was clothed with camel's hair. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
not like the Winged Precursor familiar to the painter of icons;
but his charm was irresistible. What was the significance of the
subtle smile with which he pointed to the cross of Golgotha?
</p><p>
Eutychius stood spell-bound, scarce listening to the
animadversions of his fellows. 'What? this beardless, naked,
effeminate youth, the Precursor? Not of Christ, then, but of
Antichrist&mdash;accursed for ever!'
</p><p>
Eutychius heard without heeding; and when he came away
the mysterious figure of the wingless one, fair as a woman,
with flowing locks like Dionysus, pointing to the cross&mdash;haunted
him like a vision.
</p><p>
The young Russian painter was lodged in an attic beside
the dove-cot; and had arranged his working place in the
recess of the dormer-window.
</p><p>
He busied himself with the painting of the icon, already
nearly completed, of St. John the Baptist. The saint
stood on a sunburnt hill, round, like the edge of a globe.
It was bordered by the purple sea, and canopied by the
blue vault of heaven. The figure carried in its hand a head,
which was the duplicate of his own, but seemed that of a
corpse. Thus Eutychius had tried to show that the man
who has slain in himself all that is human may attain to a
more than human flight. His face was terrible and strange;
his gaze like the gaze of an eagle, fixed upon the sun. His
hair and beard floated on the blast, his raiment was like the
plumage of a bird. His limbs were long and gave an impression
of singular lightness. On his shoulder were set great
swan-like wings, extended over the tawny earth and the
purple sea.
</p><p>
To-night Eutychius had little more to do than to touch
the inner side of the plumes with gold. But his attention
wandered, he thought of Dædalus and of Leonardo; he
remembered the face of the wingless youth in the Master's
last picture, and found it eclipsing that of the winged one
which he had drawn himself. His hand grew heavy and
uncertain; the brush fell; his strength failed. He left
his room and wandered for hours along the banks of the
silent river.
</p><p>
The sun had set; the pale green sky, the evening stars
were reflected in the water, but in the east clouds were
rising, and summer lightning quivered in the air as if waving
fiery wings.
</p><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
Returning, he lit the lamp before the icon of the Virgin,
and threw himself on his bed. He could not sleep, but lay
tossing and shivering feverishly for hour after hour, fancying
weird rustlings and whispers in the stillness, and remembering
all the eerie tales of the Russian folk-lore.
</p><p>
Wearied and wakeful, Eutychius tried to read. He selected
an old book at random, and the familiar Russian legend of
the 'Crown of the Kingdom of Babylon,' and of the world-wide
sovereignty destined by God for the land of Russia. Then
Eutychius turned a page and read another legend, that of
'The White Hood.'
</p><p>
In days of yore Constantine the emperor, having accepted
the Christian faith and received absolution for his sins from
Sylvester the pope, desired to give the pontiff a kingly crown.
But an angel, appearing unto him, bade him give a crown not
of earthly but of spiritual supremacy&mdash;a White Hood like unto
a monkish cowl. Nevertheless the Roman Church laid claim
to temporal no less than to spiritual power; wherefore the
angel appeared to the pope and commanded him to send the
Hood to Philotheus, the Patriarch of Constantinople; and
when he would have retained it, there appeared unto the
Patriarch another vision: Constantine the emperor and
Sylvester the pope, bidding him send on the Hood yet further,
into the country of Russia, to Novgorod the Great.
</p><p>
'For,' said Sylvester in this dream, 'the first Rome has
fallen by her pride and self-will; and Constantinople, the
second Rome, is like to perish by the fury of the infidel; but
in the third Rome, which shall be in the land of Russia, the
light of the Holy Ghost is already shining, and at the last all
Christian nations shall be united in the Russian dominion
under the shadow of the Orthodox faith.'
</p><p>
Each time Eutychius read these tales, a vague and boundless
hope filled his soul. His heart beat and his breath caught,
as though he were standing on the edge of a precipice. For
it seemed that the legend of the Babylonian kingdom was
prophetic of earthly greatness; that of the White Hood, of
heavenly glory for his native land. However poor, however
wretched she might be now in comparison with other
countries, still she was to be the third Rome, the new Zion;
and the rays of the rising sun were destined to shine on the
seventeen golden domes of the Russian church of St. Sophia,
the Wisdom of God. And yet, he asked himself, how should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
it be that the White Hood, the third, the holiest Rome,
should unite itself with the hateful crown of Nebuchadnezzar,
who had been cursed of God, whose city was Babylon, and
accursed in the Book of Revelation. The young painter's
effort to solve the riddle brought fantastic vision to his hot
brain.
</p><p>
He fell asleep, and he too dreamed a dream:
</p><p>
He saw a Woman in shining garments, with flaming countenance
and fiery wings, standing among fleeting clouds,
her feet on the crescent moon; over her was a seven-pillared
tabernacle, with the inscription:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Wisdom hath builded her an house.'
</p><p>
Prophets and patriarchs surrounded her, saints and angels,
thrones and dominions and powers, and all the company of
Heaven. And among the prophets at Wisdom's very foot
stood John the Precursor with his white plumes as on the
icon, <i>but wearing the face of Leonardo da Vinci</i>, who had
dreamed of wings for men. And behind the Woman, golden
cupolas and pinnacles of churches innumerable glowed like
fire in the azure sky; and beyond them stretched a gloriously
boundless expanse, which Eutychius recognised as the land of
Russia.
</p><p>
Belfries shook with a triumphant peal; angels sang
victorious Alleluia; the seven archangels smote their wings,
and the seven thunders spoke. And above the fire-clothed
Woman, Hagia Sophia, the Wisdom of God, the heavens
opened, and bright as the sun&mdash;terrible&mdash;shone the White
Hood, the heavenly head-dress, over the land of Russia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Eutychius awoke. He opened the windows, and to him
was wafted the fragrance of leaves and grasses washed by rain.
The sun had not yet risen, but gold and purple decked the
place of his coming&mdash;the skyey verge above the woods, and
the river, and the fields. The town still slept in twilight;
only the belfry of St. Hubert glistened with a pale green light.
The hush was full of great expectation. Far away on the
sand-banks of the Loire the white swans were calling.
</p><p>
Suddenly, like a live coal, the sun shone out behind the
forest. Something like music passed across the earth and
the heaven. Pigeons shook their wings and rose in circles.
Day, entering the window, fell full on the icon of the Forerunner;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
the wings, extended over lands and seas, flashed and
sparkled in the morning radiance, as if informed with supernatural
life.
</p><p>
Eutychius, dipping his brush into crimson, wrote these
words on the scroll upon the icon, under the Winged Precursor:&mdash;
</p><p>
"Behold I will send my messenger before my face, and he
shall prepare my way before me."</p>
